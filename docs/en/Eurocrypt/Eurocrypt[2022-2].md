### Abstract
> We construct new private-information-retrieval protocols in the single-server setting. Our schemes allow a client to privately fetch a sequence of database records from a server, while the server answers each query in average time sublinear in the database size. Specifically, we introduce the first single-server private-information-retrieval schemes that have sublinear amortized server time, require sublinear additional storage, and allow the client to make her queries adaptively. Our protocols rely only on standard cryptographic assumptions (decision Diffie-Hellman, quadratic residuosity, learning with errors, etc.). They work by having the client first fetch a small ‚Äúhint‚Äù about the database contents from the server. Generating this hint requires server time linear in the database size. Thereafter, the client can use the hint to make a bounded number of adaptive queries to the server, which the server answers in sublinear time‚Äîyielding sublinear amortized cost. Finally, we give lower bounds proving that our most efficient scheme is optimal with respect to the trade-off it achieves between server online time and client storage.

### Abstract
> Cryptosystems have been developed over the years under the typical prevalent setting which assumes that the receiver‚Äôs key is kept secure from the adversary, and that the choice of the message to be sent is freely performed by the sender and is kept secure from the adversary as well. Under these fundamental and basic operational assumptions, modern Cryptography has flourished over the last half a century or so, with amazing achievements: New systems (including public-key Cryptography), beautiful and useful models (including security definitions such as semantic security), and new primitives (such as zero-knowledge proofs) have been developed. Furthermore, these fundamental achievements have been translated into actual working systems, and span many of the daily human activities over the Internet.

### Abstract
> The celebrated PCP Theorem states that any language in \(\mathrm {NP}\) can be decided via a verifier that reads O(1) bits from a polynomially long proof. Interactive oracle proofs (IOP), a generalization of PCPs, allow the verifier to interact with the prover for multiple rounds while reading a small number of bits from each prover message. While PCPs are relatively well understood, the power captured by IOPs (beyond \(\mathrm {NP}\)) has yet to be fully explored.

### Abstract
> We construct an efficient dynamic group signature (or more generally an accountable ring signature) from isogeny and lattice assumptions. Our group signature is based on a simple generic construction that can be instantiated by cryptographically hard group actions such as the CSIDH group action or an MLWE-based group action. The signature is of size \(O(\log N)\), where N is the number of users in the group. Our idea builds on the recent efficient OR-proof by Beullens, Katsumata, and Pintore (Asiacrypt‚Äô20), where we efficiently add a proof of valid ciphertext to their OR-proof and further show that the resulting non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system is online extractable.

### Abstract
> In Crypto‚Äô21 Gu, Jarecki, and Krawczyk [25] showed an asymmetric password authenticated key exchange protocol (aPAKE) whose computational cost matches (symmetric) password authenticated key exchange (PAKE) and plain (i.e. unauthenticated) key exchange (KE). However, this minimal-cost aPAKE did not match prior aPAKE‚Äôs in round complexity, using 4 rounds assuming the client initiates compared to 2 rounds in an aPAKE of Bradley et al. [13].

### Abstract
> We show that it is possible to perform n independent copies of 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer in two messages, where the communication complexity of the receiver and sender (each) is \(n(1+o(1))\) for sufficiently large n. Note that this matches the information-theoretic lower bound. Prior to this work, this was only achievable by using the heavy machinery of rate-1 fully homomorphic encryption (Rate-1 FHE, Brakerski et al., TCC 2019).

### Abstract
> In this work, we study the communication complexity of secure multiparty computation under minimal assumptions in the presence of an adversary that can adaptively corrupt all parties eventually. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the complexity when modeling the underlying function as a RAM program. Under minimal assumptions, the work of Canetti et al. (STOC 2017) and Benhamouda et al. (TCC 2018) give protocols whose communication complexity grows quadratically in the circuit size when the computation is expressed as a Boolean circuit. In this work, we obtain the first two-round two-party computation protocol, which is secure against adaptive adversaries who can adaptively corrupt all parties where the communication complexity is proportional to the square of the RAM complexity of the function up to polylogarithmic factors assuming the existence of non-committing encryption.

### Abstract
> We present a new, simple candidate broadcast encryption scheme for N users with parameter size \(\textsf {poly}(\log N)\). We prove security of our scheme under a non-standard variant of the LWE assumption where the distinguisher additionally receives short Gaussian pre-images while avoiding zeroizing attacks. This yields the first candidate optimal broadcast encryption that is plausibly post-quantum secure, and enjoys a security reduction to a simple assumption. As a secondary contribution, we present a candidate ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme for circuits of a-priori bounded polynomial depth where the parameter size is independent of the circuit size, and prove security under an additional non-standard assumption.

### Abstract
> Universal Composability is a widely used concept for the design and analysis of protocols. Since Canetti‚Äôs original UC model and the model by Pfitzmann and Waidner several different models for universal composability have been proposed, including, for example, the IITM model, GNUC, CC, but also extensions and restrictions of the UC model, such as JUC, GUC, and SUC. These were motivated by the lack of expressivity of existing models, ease of use, or flaws in previous models. Cryptographers choose between these models based on their needs at hand (e.g., support for joint state and global state) or simply their familiarity with a specific model. While all models follow the same basic idea, there are huge conceptually differences, which raises fundamental and practical questions: (How) do the concepts and results proven in one model relate to those in another model? Do the different models and the security notions formulated therein capture the same classes of attacks? Most importantly, can cryptographers re-use results proven in one model in another model, and if so, how?

### Abstract
> Succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) are cryptographic proofs with strong efficiency properties. Applications of SNARKs often involve proving computations that include the SNARK verifier, a technique called recursive composition. Unfortunately, SNARKs with desirable features such as a transparent (public-coin) setup are known only in the random oracle model (ROM). In applications this oracle must be heuristically instantiated and used in a non-black-box way.

### Abstract
> At CANS‚Äô20, El Housni and Guillevic introduced a new 2-chain of pairing-friendly elliptic curves for recursive zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) made of the former BLS12-377 curve (a Barreto‚ÄìLynn‚ÄìScott curve over a 377-bit prime field) and the new BW6-761 curve (a Brezing‚ÄìWeng curve of embedding degree 6 over a 761-bit prime field). First we generalise the curve construction, the pairing formulas (\(e :\mathbb G_1 \times \mathbb G_2 \rightarrow \mathbb G_T\)) and the group operations to any BW6 curve defined on top of any BLS12 curve, forming a family of 2-chain pairing-friendly curves.

### Abstract
> We introduce a new class of succinct arguments, that we call elastic. Elastic SNARKs allow the prover to allocate different resources (such as memory and time) depending on the execution environment and the statement to prove. The resulting output is independent of the prover‚Äôs configuration. To study elastic SNARKs, we extend the streaming paradigm of [Block et al., TCC‚Äô20]. We provide a definitional framework for elastic polynomial interactive oracle proofs for R1CS instances and design a compiler which transforms an elastic PIOP into a preprocessing argument system that supports streaming or random access to its inputs. Depending on the configuration, the prover will choose different trade-offs for time (either linear, or quasilinear) and memory (either linear, or logarithmic). We prove the existence of elastic SNARKS by presenting Gemini, a novel FFT-free preprocessing argument. We prove its security and develop a proof-of-concept implementation in Rust based on the arkworks framework. We provide benchmarks for large R1CS instances of tens of billions of gates on a single machine.

### Abstract
> Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs for disjunctive statements have been a focus of a long line of research. Classical results such as Cramer et al. [CRYPTO‚Äô94] and Abe et al. [AC‚Äô02] design generic compilers that transform certain classes of ZK proofs into ZK proofs for disjunctive statements. However, communication complexity of the resulting protocols in these results ends up being proportional to the complexity of proving all clauses in the disjunction. More recently, Heath et al. [EC‚Äô20] exploited special properties of garbled circuits to construct efficient ZK proofs for disjunctions, where the proof size is only proportional to the length of the largest clause in the disjunction. However, these techniques do not appear to generalize beyond garbled circuits.

### Abstract
> The standard model security of the Fiat-Shamir transform has been an active research area for many years. In breakthrough results, Canetti et al. (STOC‚Äô19) and Peikert-Shiehian (Crypto‚Äô19) showed that, under the Learning-With-Errors (\(\mathsf {LWE}_{}\)) assumption, it provides soundness by applying correlation-intractable (CI) hash functions to so-called trapdoor \(\varSigma \)-protocols. In order to be compatible with CI hash functions based on standard \(\mathsf {LWE}_{}\) assumptions with polynomial approximation factors, all known such protocols have been obtained via parallel repetitions of a basic protocol with binary challenges. In this paper, we consider languages related to Paillier‚Äôs composite residuosity assumption (\(\mathsf {DCR}\)) for which we give the first trapdoor \(\varSigma \)-protocols providing soundness in one shot, via exponentially large challenge spaces. This improvement is analogous to the one enabled by Schnorr over the original Fiat-Shamir protocol in the random oracle model. Using the correlation-intractable hash function paradigm, we then obtain simulation-sound NIZK arguments showing that an element of \(\mathbb {Z}_{N^2}^*\) is a composite residue, which opens the door to space-efficient applications in the standard model. As a concrete example, we build logarithmic-size ring signatures (assuming a common reference string) with the shortest signature length among schemes based on standard assumptions in the standard model. We prove security under the \(\mathsf {DCR}\) and \(\mathsf {LWE}_{}\) assumptions, while keeping the signature size comparable with that of random-oracle-based schemes.

In particular, assuming the sub-exponential hardness of both the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) and Quadratic Residuosity (QR) assumptions, we obtain the following results, where n denotes the length of the instance:

> Unique signatures are digital signatures with exactly one unique and valid signature for each message. The security reduction for most unique signatures has a natural reduction loss (in the existentially unforgeable against chosen-message attacks, namely EUF-CMA, security model under a non-interactive hardness assumption). In Crypto 2017, Guo et al. proposed a particular chain-based unique signature scheme where each unique signature is composed of n BLS signatures computed sequentially like a blockchain. Under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption, their reduction loss is \(n\cdot q_H^{1/n}\) for \(q_H\) hash queries and it is logarithmically tight when \(n=\log {q_H}\). However, it is currently unknown whether a better reduction than logarithmical tightness for the chain-based unique signatures exists.

### Abstract
> Constructing one-way functions from average-case hardness is a long-standing open problem. A positive result would exclude Pessiland (Impagliazzo ‚Äô95) and establish a highly desirable win-win situation: either (symmetric) cryptography exists unconditionally, or all \(\mathsf {NP}\) problems can be solved efficiently on the average. Motivated by the lack of progress on this seemingly very hard question, we initiate the investigation of weaker yet meaningful candidate win-win results of the following type: either there are fine-grained one-way functions (FGOWF), or nontrivial speedups can be obtained for all \(\mathsf {NP} \) problems on the average. FGOWFs only require a fixed polynomial gap (as opposed to superpolynomial) between the running time of the function and the running time of an inverter. We obtain three main results:

### Abstract
> The Schnorr signature scheme is an efficient digital signature scheme with short signature lengths, i.e., 4k-bit signatures for k bits of security. A Schnorr signature \(\sigma \) over a group of size \(p\approx 2^{2k}\) consists of a tuple (s,¬†e), where \(e \in \{0,1\}^{2k}\) is a hash output and \(s\in \mathbb {Z}_p\) must be computed using the secret key. While the hash output e requires 2k bits to encode, Schnorr proposed that it might be possible to truncate the hash value without adversely impacting security.

### Abstract
> This paper introduces a new type of public-key encryption scheme, called Multi-Designated Receiver Signed Public Key Encryption (\(\textrm{M}{\mathrm{DRS-PKE}}\)), which allows a sender to select a set of designated receivers and both encrypt and sign a message that only these receivers will be able to read and authenticate (confidentiality and authenticity). An \(\textrm{M}{\mathrm{DRS-PKE}}\) scheme provides several additional security properties which allow for a fundamentally new type of communication not considered before. Namely, it satisfies consistency‚Äîa dishonest sender cannot make different receivers receive different messages‚Äîoff-the-record‚Äîa dishonest receiver cannot convince a third party of what message was sent (e.g., by selling their secret key), because dishonest receivers have the ability to forge signatures‚Äîand anonymity‚Äîparties that are not in the set of designated receivers cannot identify who the sender and designated receivers are.

### Abstract
> We build the first construction of a partially oblivious pseudorandom function (POPRF) that does not rely on bilinear pairings. Our construction can be viewed as combining elements of the 2HashDH OPRF of Jarecki, Kiayias, and Krawczyk with the Dodis-Yampolskiy PRF. We analyze our POPRF‚Äôs security in the random oracle model via reduction to a new one-more gap strong Diffie-Hellman inversion assumption. The most significant technical challenge is establishing confidence in the new assumption, which requires new proof techniques that enable us to show that its hardness is implied by the q-DL assumption in the algebraic group model.

### Abstract
> This paper continues the study of memory-tight reductions (Auerbach et al., CRYPTO ‚Äô17). These are reductions that only incur minimal memory costs over those of the original adversary, allowing precise security statements for memory-bounded adversaries (under appropriate assumptions expressed in terms of adversary time and memory usage). Despite its importance, only a few techniques to achieve memory-tightness are known and impossibility results in prior works show that even basic, textbook reductions cannot be made memory-tight.

### Abstract
> Functional Encryption is a powerful notion of encryption in which each decryption key is associated with a function f such that decryption recovers the function evaluation f(m). Informally, security states that a user with access to function keys \(\mathsf {sk}_{f_1}, \mathsf {sk}_{f_2}, \ldots \) (and so on) can only learn \(f_1(m), f_2(m), \ldots \) (and so on) but nothing more about the message. The system is said to be q-bounded collusion resistant if the security holds as long as an adversary gets access to at most \(q = q(\lambda )\) function keys. A major drawback of such statically bounded collusion systems is that the collusion bound q must be declared at setup time and is fixed for the entire lifetime of the system.

### Abstract
> Property-preserving hash functions allow for compressing long inputs \(x_0\) and \(x_1\) into short hashes \(h(x_0)\) and \(h(x_1)\) in a manner that allows for computing a predicate \(P(x_0, x_1)\) given only the two hash values without having access to the original data. Such hash functions are said to be adversarially robust if an adversary that gets to pick \(x_0\) and \(x_1\) after the hash function has been sampled, cannot find inputs for which the predicate evaluated on the hash values outputs the incorrect result.

### Abstract
> This paper proposes the first practical pairing-free three-move blind signature schemes that (1) are concurrently secure, (2) produce short signatures (i.e., three or four group elements/scalars), and (3) are provably secure either in the generic group model (GGM) or the algebraic group model (AGM) under the (plain or one-more) discrete logarithm assumption (beyond additionally assuming random oracles). We also propose a partially blind version of one of our schemes.

### Abstract
> Messaging platforms like Signal are widely deployed and provide strong security in an asynchronous setting. It is a challenging problem to construct a protocol with similar security guarantees that can efficiently scale to large groups. A major bottleneck are the frequent key rotations users need to perform to achieve post compromise forward security.

### Abstract
> This paper provides efficient authenticated-encryption (AE) schemes in which a ciphertext is a commitment to the key. These are extended, at minimal additional cost, to schemes where the ciphertext is a commitment to all encryption inputs, meaning key, nonce, associated data and message. Our primary schemes are modifications of GCM (for basic, unique-nonce AE security) and AES-GCM-SIV (for misuse-resistant AE security) and add both forms of commitment without any increase in ciphertext size. We also give more generic, but somewhat more costly, solutions.

### Abstract
> The pre-shared key (PSK) handshake modes of TLS¬†1.3 allow for the performant, low-latency resumption of previous connections and are widely used on the Web and by resource-constrained devices, e.g., in the Internet of Things. Taking advantage of these performance benefits with optimal and theoretically-sound parameters requires tight security proofs. We give the first tight security proofs for the TLS¬†1.3 PSK handshake modes.
