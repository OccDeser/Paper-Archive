### Abstract
> Prediction algorithms assign numbers to individuals that are popularly understood as individual “probabilities”—what is the probability that an applicant will repay a loan? Automated predictions increasingly form the basis for life-altering decisions, and this raises a host of concerns. Concerns about the fairness of the resulting predictions are particularly alarming: for example, the predictor might perform poorly on a protected minority group. We survey recent developments in formalizing and addressing such concerns.

### Abstract
> In this work, we will give new attacks on the pseudorandomness of algebraic pseudorandom number generators (PRGs) of polynomial stretch. Our algorithms apply to a broad class of PRGs and are in the case of general local PRGs faster than currently known attacks. At the same time, in contrast to most algebraic attacks, subexponential time and space bounds will be proven for our attacks without making any assumptions of the PRGs or assuming any further conjectures. Therefore, we yield in this text the first subexponential distinguishing attacks on PRGs from constant-degree polynomials and close current gaps in the subexponential cryptoanalysis of lightweight PRGs.

### Abstract
> In this work, we initiate a study of K-NIKE protocols in the fine-grained setting, in which there is a polynomial gap between the running time of the honest parties and that of the adversary. Our goal is to show the possibility, or impossibility, of basing such protocols on weaker assumptions than those of K-NIKE for \(K \ge 3\). Our contribution is threefold.

### Abstract
> The goal of the bounded storage model (BSM) is to construct unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols, by only restricting the storage capacity of the adversary, but otherwise giving it unbounded computational power. Here, we consider a streaming variant of the BSM, where honest parties can stream huge amounts of data to each other so as to overwhelm the adversary’s storage, even while their own storage capacity is significantly smaller than that of the adversary. Prior works showed several impressive results in this model, including key agreement and oblivious transfer, but only as long as adversary’s storage \(m = O(n^2)\) is at most quadratically larger than the honest user storage n. Moreover, the work of Dziembowski and Maurer (DM) also gave a seemingly matching lower bound, showing that key agreement in the BSM is impossible when \(m > n^2\).

### Abstract
> Commitments are fundamental in cryptography. In the classical world, commitments are equivalent to the existence of one-way functions. It is also known that the most desired form of commitments in terms of their round complexity, i.e., non-interactive commitments, cannot be built from one-way functions in a black-box way [Mahmoody-Pass, Crypto’12]. However, if one allows the parties to use quantum computation and communication, it is known that non-interactive commitments (to classical bits) are in fact possible [Koshiba-Odaira, Arxiv’11 and Bitansky-Brakerski, TCC’21].

This makes black-box use of an appropriate base commitment scheme for small tag spaces, variants of sub-exponential hinting PRG (Koppula and Waters, Crypto 2019) and variants of keyless sub-exponentially collision-resistant hash function with security against non-uniform adversaries (Bitansky, Kalai and Paneth, STOC 2018 and Bitansky and Lin, TCC 2018).

### Abstract
> Indistinguishability Obfuscation \((i\mathcal {O})\) is a highly versatile primitive implying a myriad advanced cryptographic applications. Up until recently, the state of feasibility of \(i\mathcal {O}\) was unclear, which changed with works (Jain-Lin-Sahai STOC 2021, Jain-Lin-Sahai Eurocrypt 2022) showing that \(i\mathcal {O}\) can be finally based upon well-studied hardness assumptions. Unfortunately, one of these assumptions is broken in quantum polynomial time. Luckily, the line work of Brakerski et al. Eurocrypt 2020, Gay-Pass STOC 2021, Wichs-Wee Eurocrypt 2021, Brakerski et al. ePrint 2021, Devadas et al. TCC 2021 simultaneously created new pathways to construct \(i\mathcal {O}\) with plausible post-quantum security from new assumptions, namely a new form of circular security of LWE in the presence of leakages. At the same time, effective cryptanalysis of this line of work has also begun to emerge (Hopkins et al. Crypto 2021).

### Abstract
> In the setting of subversion, an adversary tampers with the machines of the honest parties thus leaking the honest parties’ secrets through the protocol transcript. The work of Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz (EUROCRYPT’15) introduced the idea of reverse firewalls (RF) to protect against tampering of honest parties’ machines. All known constructions in the RF framework rely on the malleability of the underlying operations in order for the RF to rerandomize/sanitize the transcript. RFs are thus limited to protocols that offer some structure, and hence based on public-key operations. In this work, we initiate the study of efficient Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocols in the presence of tampering. In this regard,

### Abstract
> The notion of Endemic Oblivious Transfer (EOT) was introduced by Masny and Rindal (CCS’19). EOT offers a weaker security guarantee than the conventional random OT; namely, the malicious parties can fix their outputs arbitrarily. The authors presented a 1-round UC-secure EOT protocol under a tailor-made and non-standard assumption, Choose-and-Open DDH, in the RO model.

### Abstract
> GGM tree is widely used in the design of correlated oblivious transfer (COT), subfield vector oblivious linear evaluation (sVOLE), distributed point function (DPF), and distributed comparison function (DCF). Often, the cost associated with GGM tree dominates the computation and communication of these protocols. In this paper, we propose a suite of optimizations that can reduce this cost by half.

### Abstract
> We present a new template for building oblivious transfer from quantum information that we call the “fixed basis” framework. Our framework departs from prior work (e.g., Crepeau and Kilian, FOCS’88) by fixing the correct choice of measurement basis used by each player, except for some hidden trap qubits that are intentionally measured in a conjugate basis. We instantiate this template in the quantum random oracle model (QROM) to obtain simple protocols that implement, with security against malicious adversaries:

### Abstract
> We construct a single-server pre-processing Private Information Retrieval (PIR) scheme with optimal bandwidth and server computation (up to poly-logarithmic factors), assuming hardness of the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem. Our scheme achieves amortized \(\widetilde{O}_{\lambda }(\sqrt{n})\) server and client computation and \(\widetilde{O}_\lambda (1)\) bandwidth per query, completes in a single roundtrip, and requires \(\widetilde{O}_\lambda (\sqrt{n})\) client storage. In particular, we achieve a significant reduction in bandwidth over the state-of-the-art scheme by Corrigan-Gibbs, Henzinger, and Kogan (Eurocrypt’22): their scheme requires as much as \(\widetilde{O}_{\lambda }(\sqrt{n})\) bandwidth per query, with comparable computational and storage overhead as ours.

### Abstract
> We propose a new garbled RAM construction called NanoGRAM, which achieves an amortized cost of \(\widetilde{O}(\lambda \cdot (W \log N + \log ^3 N))\) bits per memory access, where \(\lambda \) is the security parameter, W is the block size, and N is the total number of blocks, and \(\widetilde{O}(\cdot )\) hides \({\textsf{poly}} \log \log \) factors. For sufficiently large blocks where \(W = \varOmega (\log ^2 N)\), our scheme achieves \(\widetilde{O}(\lambda \cdot W \log N)\) cost per memory access, where the dependence on N is optimal (barring \({\textsf{poly}} \log \log \) factors), in terms of the evaluator’s runtime. Our asymptotical performance matches even the interactive state-of-the-art (modulo \({\textsf{poly}} \log \log \) factors), that is, running Circuit ORAM atop garbled circuit, and yet we remove the logarithmic number of interactions necessary in this baseline. Furthermore, we achieve asymptotical improvement over the recent work of Heath et al. (Eurocrypt ’22). Our scheme adopts the same assumptions as the mainstream literature on practical garbled circuits, i.e., circular correlation-robust hashes or a random oracle. We evaluate the concrete performance of NanoGRAM and compare it with a couple of baselines that are asymptotically less efficient. We show that NanoGRAM starts to outperform the naïve linear-scan garbled RAM at a memory size of \(N = 2^9\) and starts to outperform the recent construction of Heath et al. at \(N = 2^{13}\).

### Abstract
> In recent years, there has been significant work in studying data structures that provide privacy for the operations that are executed. These primitives aim to guarantee that observable access patterns to physical memory do not reveal substantial information about the queries and updates executed on the data structure. Multiple recent works, including Larsen and Nielsen [Crypto’18], Persiano and Yeo [Eurocrypt’19], Hubáček et al. [TCC’19] and Komargodski and Lin [Crypto’21], have shown that logarithmic overhead is required to support even basic RAM (array) operations for various privacy notions including obliviousness and differential privacy as well as different choices of sizes for RAM blocks b and memory cells \(\omega \).

### Abstract
> In this paper, we study (batch) private information retrieval with private preprocessing. Private information retrieval (PIR) is the problem where one or more servers hold a database of n bits and a client wishes to retrieve the i-th bit in the database from the server(s). In PIR with private preprocessing (also known as offline-online PIR), the client is able to compute a private r-bit hint in an offline stage that may be leveraged to perform retrievals accessing at most t entries. For privacy, the client wishes to hide index i from an adversary that has compromised some of the servers. In the batch PIR setting, the client performs queries to retrieve the contents of multiple entries simultaneously.

### Abstract
> We study the task of obliviously compressing a vector comprised of n ciphertexts of size \(\xi \) bits each, where at most t of the corresponding plaintexts are non-zero. This problem commonly features in applications involving encrypted outsourced storages, such as searchable encryption or oblivious message retrieval. We present two new algorithms with provable worst-case guarantees, solving this problem by using only homomorphic additions and multiplications by constants. Both of our new constructions improve upon the state of the art asymptotically and concretely.

### Abstract
> We introduce the notion of public key encryption with secure key leasing (PKE-SKL). Our notion supports the leasing of decryption keys so that a leased key achieves the decryption functionality but comes with the guarantee that if the quantum decryption key returned by a user passes a validity test, then the user has lost the ability to decrypt. Our notion is similar in spirit to the notion of secure software leasing (SSL) introduced by Ananth and La Placa (Eurocrypt 2021) but captures significantly more general adversarial strategies. (In more detail, our adversary is not restricted to use an honest evaluation algorithm to run pirated software.) Our results can be summarized as follows:

### Abstract
> Recently, Aaronson et al. (arXiv:2009.07450) showed that detecting interference between two orthogonal states is as hard as swapping these states. While their original motivation was from quantum gravity, we show its applications in quantum cryptography.
