<blockquote>
<p>The beautiful work of Applebaum, Ishai, and Kushilevitz [FOCS‚Äô11] initiated the study of arithmetic variants of Yao‚Äôs garbled circuits. An arithmetic garbling scheme is an efficient transformation that converts an arithmetic circuit (C: \mathcal {R}^n \rightarrow \mathcal {R}^m) over a ring (\mathcal {R}) into a garbled circuit (\widehat{C}) and n affine functions (L_i) for (i \in [n]), such that (\widehat{C}) and (L_i(x_i)) reveals only the output C(x) and no other information of x. AIK presented the first arithmetic garbling scheme supporting computation over integers from a bounded (possibly exponentially large) range, based on Learning With Errors (LWE). In contrast, converting C into a Boolean circuit and applying Yao‚Äôs garbled circuit treats the inputs as bit strings instead of ring elements, and hence is not ‚Äúarithmetic‚Äù.</p>
<p>In this work, we present new ways to garble arithmetic circuits, which improve the state-of-the-art on efficiency, modularity, and functionality. To measure efficiency, we define the rate of a garbling scheme as the maximal ratio between the bit-length of the garbled circuit (|\widehat{C}|) and that of the computation tableau (|C|\ell ) in the clear, where (\ell ) is the bit length of wire values (e.g., Yao‚Äôs garbled circuit has rate (O(\lambda ))).</p>
<p>We present the first constant-rate arithmetic garbled circuit for computation over large integers based on the Decisional Composite Residuosity (DCR) assumption, significantly improving the efficiency of the schemes of Applebaum, Ishai, and Kushilevitz.</p>
<p>We construct an arithmetic garbling scheme for modular computation over (\mathcal {R}= \mathbb {Z}_p) for any integer modulus p, based on either DCR or LWE. The DCR-based instantiation achieves rate (O(\lambda )) for large p. Furthermore, our construction is modular and makes black-box use of the underlying ring and a simple key extension gadget.</p>
<p>We describe a variant of the first scheme supporting arithmetic circuits over bounded integers that are augmented with Boolean computation (e.g., truncation of an integer value, and comparison between two values), while keeping the constant rate when garbling the arithmetic part.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, constant-rate (Boolean or arithmetic) garbling was only achieved before using the powerful primitive of indistinguishability obfuscation, or for restricted circuits with small depth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actively secure two-party computation (2PC) is one of the canonical building blocks in modern cryptography. One main goal for designing actively secure 2PC protocols is to reduce the communication overhead, compared to semi-honest 2PC protocols. In this paper, we propose a new actively secure constant-round 2PC protocol with one-way communication of (2\kappa +5) bits per AND gate (for (\kappa )-bit computational security and any statistical security), essentially matching the one-way communication of semi-honest half-gates protocol. This is achieved by two new techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The recent compression technique by Dittmer et al. (Crypto 2022) shows that a relaxed preprocessing is sufficient for authenticated garbling that does not reveal masked wire values to the garbler. We introduce a new form of authenticated bits and propose a new technique of generating authenticated AND triples to reduce the one-way communication of preprocessing from (5\rho +1) bits to 2 bits per AND gate for (\rho )-bit statistical security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unfortunately, the above compressing technique is only compatible with a less compact authenticated garbled circuit of size (2\kappa +3\rho ) bits per AND gate. We designed a new authenticated garbling that does not use information theoretic MACs but rather dual execution without leakage to authenticate wire values in the circuit. This allows us to use a more compact half-gates based authenticated garbled circuit of size (2\kappa +1) bits per AND gate, and meanwhile keep compatible with the compression technique. Our new technique can achieve one-way communication of (2\kappa +5) bits per AND gate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our technique of yielding authenticated AND triples can also be used to optimize the two-way communication (i.e., the total communication) by combining it with the authenticated garbled circuits by Dittmer et al., which results in an actively secure 2PC protocol with two-way communication of (2\kappa +3\rho +4) bits per AND gate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We revisit the problem of reusable non-interactive secure computation (NISC). A standard NISC protocol for a sender-receiver functionality f enables the receiver to encrypt its input x such that any sender, on input y, can send back a message revealing only f(x, y). Security should hold even when either party can be malicious. A reusable NISC protocol has the additional feature that the receiver‚Äôs message can be safely reused for computing multiple outputs (f(x,y_i)). Here security should hold even when a malicious sender can learn partial information about the honest receiver‚Äôs outputs in each session.</p>
<p>We present the first reusable NISC protocol for general functions f that only makes a black-box use of any two-message oblivious transfer protocol, along with a random oracle. All previous reusable NISC protocols either made a non-black-box use of cryptographic primitives (Cachin et al. ICALP 2002) or alternatively required a stronger arithmetic variant of oblivious transfer and were restricted to f in (\textsf{NC}^1) or similar classes (Chase et al. Crypto 2019). Our result is obtained via a general compiler from standard NISC to reusable NISC that makes use of special type of honest-majority protocols for secure multiparty computation.</p>
<p>Finally, we extend the above main result to reusable two-sided NISC, in which two parties can encrypt their inputs in the first round and then reveal different functions of their inputs in multiple sessions. This extension either requires an additional (black-box) use of additively homomorphic commitment or alternatively requires the parties to maintain a state between sessions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We study strong versions of round-optimal MPC. A recent work of Benhamouda and Lin (TCC ‚Äô20) identified a version of secure multiparty computation (MPC), termed Multiparty reusable Non-Interactive Secure Computation (MrNISC), that combines at the same time several fundamental aspects of secure computation with standard simulation security into one primitive: round-optimality, succinctness, concurrency, and adaptivity. In more detail, MrNISC is essentially a two-round MPC protocol where the first round of messages serves as a reusable commitment to the private inputs of participating parties. Using these commitments, any subset of parties can later compute any function of their choice on their respective inputs by broadcasting one message each. Anyone who sees these parties‚Äô commitments and evaluation messages (even an outside observer) can learn the function output and nothing else. Importantly, the input commitments can be computed without knowing anything about other participating parties (neither their identities nor their number) and they are reusable across any number of computations.</p>
<p>By now, there are several known MrNISC protocols from either (bilinear) group-based assumptions or from LWE. They all satisfy semi-malicious security (in the plain model) and require trusted setup assumptions in order to get malicious security. We are interested in maliciously secure MrNISC protocols in the plain model, without trusted setup. Since the standard notion of polynomial simulation is un-achievable in less than four rounds, we focus on security with super-polynomial-time simulation (SPS).</p>
<p>Our main result is the first maliciously secure SPS MrNISC in the plain model. The result is obtained by generically compiling any semi-malicious MrNISC and the security of our compiler relies on several well-studied assumptions of an indistinguishability obfuscator, DDH over ({\mathbb Z} ^*_{p}) and asymmetric pairing groups, and a time-lock puzzle (all of which need to be sub-exponentially hard). As a special case, we obtain the first 2-round maliciously secure SPS MPC based on well-founded assumptions. This MPC is also concurrently self-composable and its first message is short (i.e., its size is independent of the number of the participating parties) and reusable throughout any number of computations. Prior to our work, for two round maliciously secure MPC, neither concurrent MPC nor reusable MPC nor MPC with first message independent in the number of parties was known from any set of assumptions. Of independent interest is one of our building blocks: the first construction of a one-round non-malleable commitment scheme from well-studied assumptions, avoiding keyless hash functions and non-standard hardness amplification assumptions. The full version of this paper can be found at [26].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this paper we consider two-round secure computation protocols which use different communication channels in different rounds: namely, protocols where broadcast is available in neither round, both rounds, only the first round, or only the second round. The prior works of Cohen, Garay and Zikas (Eurocrypt 2020) and Damg√•rd, Magri, Ravi, Siniscalchi and Yakoubov (Crypto 2021) give tight characterizations of which security guarantees are achievable for various thresholds in each communication structure .</p>
<p>In this work, we introduce a new security notion, namely, selective identifiable abort, which guarantees that every honest party either obtains the output, or aborts identifying one corrupt party (where honest parties may potentially identify different corrupted parties). We investigate what broadcast patterns in two-round MPC allow achieving this guarantee across various settings (such as with or without PKI, with or without an honest majority).</p>
<p>Further, we determine what is possible in the honest majority setting without a PKI, closing a question left open by Damg√•rd et al. We show that without a PKI, having an honest majority does not make it possible to achieve stronger security guarantees compared to the dishonest majority setting. However, if two-thirds of the parties are guaranteed to be honest, identifiable abort is additionally achievable using broadcast only in the second round.</p>
<p>We use fundamentally different techniques from the previous works to avoid relying on private communication in the first round when a PKI is not available, since assuming such private channels without the availability of public encryption keys is unrealistic. We also show that, somewhat surprisingly, the availability of private channels in the first round does not enable stronger security guarantees unless the corruption threshold is one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secure computation enables mutually distrusting parties to jointly compute a function on their secret inputs, while revealing nothing beyond the function output. A long-running challenge is understanding the required communication complexity of such protocols‚Äîin particular, when communication can be sublinear in the circuit representation size of the desired function. Significant advances have been made affirmatively answering this question within the two-party setting, based on a variety of structures and hardness assumptions. In contrast, in the multi-party setting, only one general approach is known: using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). This remains the state of affairs even for just three parties, with two corruptions.</p>
<p>We present a framework for achieving secure sublinear-communication ((N+1))-party computation, building from a particular form of Function Secret Sharing for only N parties. In turn, we demonstrate implications to sublinear secure computation for various function classes in the 3-party and 5-party settings based on an assortment of assumptions not known to imply FHE.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We study the complexity of two-party secure arithmetic computation where the goal is to evaluate an arithmetic circuit over a finite field (\mathbb {F}) in the presence of an active (aka malicious) adversary. In the passive setting, Applebaum et al. (Crypto 2017) constructed a protocol that only makes a constant (amortized) number of field operations per gate. This protocol uses the underlying field (\mathbb {F}) as a black box, makes black-box use of (standard) oblivious transfer, and its security is based on arithmetic analogs of well-studied cryptographic assumptions. We present an actively-secure variant of this protocol that achieves, for the first time, all the above features. The protocol relies on the same assumptions and adds only a minor overhead in computation and communication.</p>
<p>Along the way, we construct a highly-efficient Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (VOLE) protocol and present several practical and theoretical optimizations, as well as a prototype implementation. Our most efficient variant can achieve an asymptotic rate of 1/4 (i.e., for vectors of length w we send roughly 4w elements of (\mathbb {F})), which is only slightly worse than the passively-secure protocol whose rate is 1/3. The protocol seems to be practically competitive over fast networks, even for relatively small fields (\mathbb {F}) and relatively short vectors. Specifically, our VOLE protocol has 3 rounds, and even for 10K-long vectors, it has an amortized cost per entry of less than 4 OT‚Äôs and less than 300 arithmetic operations. Most of these operations (about 200) can be pre-processed locally in an offline non-interactive phase. (Better constants can be obtained for longer vectors.) Some of our optimizations rely on a novel intractability assumption regarding the non-malleability of noisy linear codes, that may be of independent interest.</p>
<p>Our technical approach employs two new ingredients. First, we present a new information-theoretic construction of Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) and show how to use it in order to immunize the VOLE protocol of Applebaum et al. against active adversaries. Second, by using elementary properties of low-degree polynomials, we show that, for some simple arithmetic functionalities, one can easily upgrade Yao‚Äôs garbled-circuit protocol to the active setting with a minor overhead while preserving the round complexity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this work we present a novel actively secure dishonest majority MPC protocol, SuperPack, whose efficiency improves as the number of honest parties increases. Concretely, let (0&lt;\epsilon &lt;1/2) and consider an adversary that corrupts (t&lt;n(1-\epsilon )) out of n parties. SuperPack requires (6/\epsilon ) field elements of online communication per multiplication gate across all parties, assuming circuit-dependent preprocessing, and (10/\epsilon ) assuming circuit-independent preprocessing. In contrast, most of previous works such as SPDZ (Damg√•rd et al., ESORICS 2013) and its derivatives perform the same regardless of whether there is only one honest party, or a constant (non-majority) fraction of honest parties. The only exception is due to Goyal et al. (CRYPTO 2022), which achieves (58/\epsilon + 96/\epsilon ^2) field elements assuming circuit-independent preprocessing. Our work improves this result substantially by a factor of at least 25 in the circuit-independent preprocessing model.</p>
<p>Practically, we also compare our work with the best concretely efficient online protocol Turbospeedz (Ben-Efraim et al., ACNS 2019), which achieves (2(1-\epsilon )n) field elements per multiplication gate among all parties. Our online protocol improves over Turbospeedz as n grows, and as (\epsilon ) approaches 1/2. For example, if there are (90\%) corruptions ((\epsilon =0.1)), with (n=50) our online protocol is (1.5\times ) better than Turbospeedz and with (n=100) this factor is (3\times ), but for (70\%) corruptions ((\epsilon =0.3)) with (n=50) our online protocol is (3.5\times ) better, and for (n=100) this factor is (7\times ).</p>
<p>Our circuit-dependent preprocessing can be instantiated from OLE/VOLE. The amount of OLE/VOLE correlations required in our work is a factor of (\approx \epsilon n/2) smaller than these required by Le Mans (Rachuri and Scholl, CRYPTO 2022) leveraged to instantiate the preprocessing of Turbospeedz.</p>
<p>Our dishonest majority protocol relies on packed secret-sharing and leverages ideas from the honest majority TurboPack (Escudero et al., CCS 2022) protocol to achieve concrete efficiency for any circuit topology, not only SIMD. We implement both SuperPack and Turbospeedz and verify with experimental results that our approach indeed leads to more competitive runtimes in distributed environments with a moderately large number of parties.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We prove that perfectly-secure optimally-resilient secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for a circuit with C gates and depth D can be obtained in ({\mathcal {O}}((Cn+n^4 + Dn^2)\log n)) communication complexity and ({\mathcal {O}}(D)) expected time. For (D \ll n) and (C\ge n^3), this is the first perfectly-secure optimal-resilient MPC protocol with linear communication complexity per gate and constant expected time complexity per layer.</p>
<p>Compared to state-of-the-art MPC protocols in the player elimination framework [Beerliova and Hirt TCC‚Äô08, and Goyal, Liu, and Song CRYPTO‚Äô19], for (C&gt;n^3) and (D \ll n), our results significantly improve the run time from (\varTheta (n+D)) to expected ({\mathcal {O}}(D)) while keeping communication complexity at ({\mathcal {O}}(Cn\log n)).</p>
<p>Compared to state-of-the-art MPC protocols that obtain an expected ({\mathcal {O}}(D)) time complexity [Abraham, Asharov, and Yanai TCC‚Äô21], for (C&gt;n^3), our results significantly improve the communication complexity from ({\mathcal {O}}(Cn^4\log n)) to ({\mathcal {O}}(Cn\log n)) while keeping the expected run time at ({\mathcal {O}}(D)).</p>
<p>One salient part of our technical contribution is centered around a new primitive we call detectable secret sharing. It is perfectly-hiding, weakly-binding, and has the property that either reconstruction succeeds, or ({\mathcal {O}}(n)) parties are (privately) detected. On the one hand, we show that detectable secret sharing is sufficiently powerful to generate multiplication triplets needed for MPC. On the other hand, we show how to share p secrets via detectable secret sharing with communication complexity of just ({\mathcal {O}}(n^4\log n+p \log n)). When sharing (p\ge n^4) secrets, the communication cost is amortized to just ({\mathcal {O}}(1)) per secret.</p>
<p>Our second technical contribution is a new Verifiable Secret Sharing protocol that can share p secrets at just ({\mathcal {O}}(n^4\log n+pn\log n)) word complexity. When sharing (p\ge n^3) secrets, the communication cost is amortized to just ({\mathcal {O}}(n)) per secret. The best prior required ({\mathcal {O}}(n^3)) communication per secret.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A proof of sequential work (PoSW) scheme allows the prover to convince a verifier that it computed a certain number of computational steps sequentially. Very recently, graph-labeling PoSW schemes, found applications in light-client blockchain protocols, most notably bootstrapping. A bootstrapping protocol allows a light client, with minimal information about the blockchain, to hold a commitment to its stable prefix.</p>
<p>An incremental PoSW (iPoSW) scheme allows the prover to non-trivially increment proofs: given (\chi ,\pi _1) and integers (N_1,N_2) such that (\pi _1) is a valid proof for (N_1), it generates a valid proof (\pi ) for (N_1+N_2).</p>
<p>In this work, we construct an iPoSW scheme based on the skiplist-based PoSW scheme of Abusalah et al. and prove its security in the random oracle model by employing the powerful on-the-fly sampling technique of D√∂ttling et al. Moreover, unlike the iPoSW scheme of D√∂ttling et al., ours is the first iPoSW scheme which is suitable for constructing incremental non-interactive arguments of chain knowledge (SNACK) schemes, which are at the heart of space and time efficient blockchain light-client protocols. In particular, our scheme works for general weight distributions, which we characterize as incrementally sampleable distributions. Our general treatment recovers the distribution underlying the scheme of D√∂ttling et al. as well as the distribution underlying SNACK-enabled bootstrapping application as special cases. In realizing our general construction, we develop a new on-the-fly sampling technique.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs) are becoming an increasingly fundamental tool in many real-world applications where the proof compactness is of the utmost importance, including blockchains. A proof of security for SNARKs in the Universal Composability (UC) framework (Canetti, FOCS‚Äô01) would rule out devastating malleability attacks. To retain security of SNARKs in the UC model, one must show their simulation-extractability such that the knowledge extractor is both black-box and straight-line, which would imply that proofs generated by honest provers are non-malleable. However, existing simulation-extractability results on SNARKs either lack some of these properties, or alternatively have to sacrifice witness succinctness to prove UC security.</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide a compiler lifting any simulation-extractable NIZKAoK into a UC-secure one in the global random oracle model, importantly, while preserving the same level of witness succinctness. Combining this with existing zkSNARKs, we achieve, to the best of our knowledge, the first zkSNARKs simultaneously achieving UC-security and constant sized proofs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Building on recent compilers for efficient disjunctive composition (e.g. an OR of multiple clauses) of zero-knowledge proofs (e.g. Goel et al. [EUROCRYPT‚Äô22]) we propose a new compiler that, when applied to sublinear-sized proofs, can result in sublinear-size disjunctive zero-knowledge with sublinear proving times (without meaningfully increasing proof sizes). Our key observation is that simulation in sublinear-size zero-knowledge proof systems can be much faster (both concretely and asymptotically) than the honest prover. We study applying our compiler to two classes of (O(\log n))-round protocols: interactive oracle proofs, specifically Aurora [EUROCRYPT‚Äô19] and Fractal [EUROCRYPT‚Äô20], and folding arguments, specifically Compressed (\varSigma )-protocols [CR-YPTO‚Äô20, CRYPTO‚Äô21] and Bulletproofs [S &amp;P‚Äô18]. This study validates that the compiler can lead to significant savings. For example, applying our compiler to Fractal enables us to prove a disjunction of (\ell ) clauses, each of size N, with only (O((N+\ell ) \cdot \text {polylog}(N))) computation, versus (O(\ell N \cdot \text {polylog}(N))) when proving the disjunction directly. We also find that our compiler offers a new lens through which to understand zero-knowledge proofs, evidenced by multiple examples of protocols with the same ‚Äústandalone‚Äù complexity that each behave very differently when stacked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proof-carrying data (PCD) is a powerful cryptographic primitive that allows mutually distrustful parties to perform distributed computation in an efficiently verifiable manner. Known constructions of PCD are obtained by recursively-composing SNARKs or related primitives. SNARKs with desirable properties such as transparent setup are constructed in the random oracle model. However, using such SNARKs to construct PCD requires heuristically instantiating the oracle and using it in a non-black-box way. [CCS22] constructed SNARKs in the low-degree random oracle model, circumventing this issue, but instantiating their model in the real world appears difficult.</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce a new model: the arithmetized random oracle model (AROM). We provide a plausible standard-model (software-only) instantiation of the AROM, and we construct PCD in the AROM, given only a standard-model collision-resistant hash function. Furthermore, our PCD construction is for arbitrary-depth compliance predicates. We obtain our PCD construction by showing how to construct SNARKs in the AROM for computations that query the oracle, given an accumulation scheme for oracle queries in the AROM. We then construct such an accumulation scheme for the AROM.</p>
<p>We give an efficient ‚Äúlazy sampling‚Äù algorithm (an emulator) for the ARO up to some error. Our emulator enables us to prove the security of cryptographic constructs in the AROM and that zkSNARKs in the ROM also satisfy zero-knowledge in the AROM. The algorithm is non-trivial, and relies on results in algebraic query complexity and the combinatorial nullstellensatz.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Generating a supersingular elliptic curve such that nobody knows its endomorphism ring is a notoriously hard task, despite several isogeny-based protocols relying on such an object. A trusted setup is often proposed as a workaround, but several aspects remain unclear. In this work, we develop the tools necessary to practically run such a distributed trusted-setup ceremony.</p>
<p>Our key contribution is the first statistically zero-knowledge proof of isogeny knowledge that is compatible with any base field. To prove statistical ZK, we introduce isogeny graphs with Borel level structure and prove they have the Ramanujan property. Then, we analyze the security of a distributed trusted-setup protocol based on our ZK proof in the simplified universal composability framework. Lastly, we develop an optimized implementation of the ZK proof, and we propose a strategy to concretely deploy the trusted-setup protocol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his landmark paper at TCC 2008 Paul Valiant introduced the notion of ‚Äúincrementally verifiable computation‚Äù which enables a prover to incrementally compute a succinct proof of correct execution of a (potentially) long running process. The paper later won the 2019 TCC test of time award. The construction was proven secure in the random oracle model without any further computational assumptions. However, the overall proof was given using a non-standard version of the random-oracle methodology where sometimes the hash function is a random oracle and sometimes it has a short description as a circuit. Valiant clearly noted that this model is non-standard, but conjectured that the standard random oracle methodology would not suffice. This conjecture has been open for 14 years. We prove that if the proof system can receive a long witness as input in an incremental manner and is also zero-knowledge then the conjecture is true. Valiant‚Äôs original construction does not have these properties but can easily be extended to have them in his model. We relate our result to recent possibility and impossibility results for SNARKs and incrementally verifiable computation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We construct succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs) for bounded-depth computations assuming that the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problem is sub-exponentially hard. This is the first construction of such SNARGs from a Diffie-Hellman assumption. Our SNARG is also unambiguous: for every (true) statement x, it is computationally hard to find any accepting proof for x other than the proof produced by the prescribed prover strategy.</p>
<p>We obtain our result by showing how to instantiate the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, under DDH, for a variant of the Goldwasser-Kalai-Rothblum (GKR) interactive proof system. Our new technical contributions are (1) giving a (TC^0) circuit family for finding roots of cubic polynomials over a special family of characteristic-2 fields (Healy-Viola, STACS 2006) and (2) constructing a variant of the GKR protocol whose invocations of the sumcheck protocol (Lund-Fortnow-Karloff-Nisan, STOC 1990) only involve degree 3 polynomials over said fields.</p>
<p>Along the way, since we can instantiate the Fiat-Shamir heuristic for certain variants of the sumcheck protocol, we also show the existence of (sub-exponentially) hard problems in the complexity class (\textsf{PPAD}), assuming the sub-exponential hardness of DDH. Previous (\textsf{PPAD}) hardness results required either bilinear maps or the learning with errors assumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plonk is a widely used succinct non-interactive proof system that uses univariate polynomial commitments. Plonk is quite flexible: it supports circuits with low-degree ‚Äúcustom‚Äù gates as well as circuits with lookup gates (a lookup gate ensures that its input is contained in a predefined table). For large circuits, the bottleneck in generating a Plonk proof is the need for computing a large FFT.</p>
<p>We present HyperPlonk, an adaptation of Plonk to the boolean hypercube, using multilinear polynomial commitments. HyperPlonk retains the flexibility of Plonk but provides several additional benefits. First, it avoids the need for an FFT during proof generation. Second, and more importantly, it supports custom gates of much higher degree than Plonk without harming the running time of the prover. Both of these can dramatically speed up the prover‚Äôs running time. Since HyperPlonk relies on multilinear polynomial commitments, we revisit two elegant constructions: one from Orion and one from Virgo. We show how to reduce the Orion opening proof size to less than 10 KB (an almost factor 1000 improvement) and show how to make the Virgo FRI-based opening proof simpler and shorter (This is an extended abstract. The full version is available on EPRINT[22]).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Increasing deployment of advanced zero-knowledge proof systems, especially zkSNARKs, has raised critical questions about their security against real-world attacks. Two classes of attacks of concern in practice are adaptive soundness attacks, where an attacker can prove false statements by choosing its public input after generating a proof, and malleability attacks, where an attacker can use a valid proof to create another valid proof it could not have created itself. Prior work has shown that simulation-extractability ((\textsf{SIM}\text {-}\textsf{EXT} )), a strong notion of security for proof systems, rules out these attacks.</p>
<p>In this paper, we prove that two transparent, discrete-log-based zkSNARKs, Spartan and Bulletproofs, are simulation-extractable ((\textsf{SIM}\text {-}\textsf{EXT} )) in the random oracle model if the discrete logarithm assumption holds in the underlying group. Since these assumptions are required to prove standard security properties for Spartan and Bulletproofs, our results show that (\textsf{SIM}\text {-}\textsf{EXT} ) is, surprisingly, ‚Äúfor free‚Äù with these schemes. Our result is the first (\textsf{SIM}\text {-}\textsf{EXT} ) proof for Spartan and encompasses both linear- and sublinear-verifier variants. Our result for Bulletproofs encompasses both the aggregate range proof and arithmetic circuit variants, and is the first to not rely on the algebraic group model (AGM), resolving an open question posed by Ganesh et al. (EUROCRYPT‚Äô22). As part of our analysis, we develop a generalization of the tree-builder extraction theorem of Attema et al. (TCC‚Äô22), which may be of independent interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unconditionally secure broadcast is feasible among parties connected by pairwise secure links only if there is a strict two-thirds majority of honest parties when no additional resources are available. This limitation may be circumvented when the parties have recourse to additional resources such as correlated randomness. Fitzi, Wolf, and Wullschleger (CRYPTO 2004) attempted to characterize the conditions on correlated randomness shared among three parties which would enable them to realize broadcast. Due to a gap in their impossibility argument, it turns out that their characterization is incorrect. Using a novel construction we show that broadcast is feasible under a considerably larger class of correlations. In fact, we realize pseudo-signatures, which are information theoretic counterparts of digital signatures using which unconditionally secure broadcast may be obtained. We also obtain a matching impossibility result thereby characterizing the class of correlations on which three-party broadcast (and pseudo-signatures) can be based. Our impossibility proof, which extends the well-know argument of Fischer, Lynch and Merritt (Distr. Comp., 1986) to the case where parties observe correlated randomness, maybe of independent interest.</p>

<p>If everyone were to use anonymous credentials for all access control needs, it would be impossible to trace wrongdoers, by design. This would make legitimate controls, such as tracing illicit trade and terror suspects, impossible to carry out. Here, we propose a privacy-preserving blueprint capability that allows an auditor to publish an encoding (\textsf{pk}<em>{\textsf{A}}) of the function (f(x,\cdot )) for a publicly known function f and a secret input x. For example, x may be a secret watchlist, and f(x, y) may return y if (y\in x). On input her data y and the auditor‚Äôs (\textsf{pk}</em>{\textsf{A}}), a user can compute an escrow (Z) such that anyone can verify that (Z) was computed correctly from the user‚Äôs credential attributes, and moreover, the auditor can recover f(x, y) from (Z). Our contributions are:</p>
<p>We define secure f-blueprint systems; our definition is designed to provide a modular extension to anonymous credential systems.</p>
<p>We show that secure f-blueprint systems can be constructed for all functions f from fully homomorphic encryption and NIZK proof systems. This result is of theoretical interest but is not efficient enough for practical use.</p>
<p>We realize an optimal blueprint system under the DDH assumption in the random-oracle model for the watchlist function.</p>
