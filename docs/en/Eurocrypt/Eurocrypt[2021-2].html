<blockquote>
<p>Motivated by new applications such as secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and Zero-Knowledge proofs (ZK), the need for symmetric encryption schemes that minimize the number of field multiplications in their natural algorithmic description is apparent. This development has brought forward many dedicated symmetric encryption schemes that minimize the number of multiplications in ( \mathbb {F}<em>{2^n} ) or ( \mathbb {F}</em>{p} ), with p being prime. These novel schemes have lead to new cryptanalytic insights that have broken many of said schemes. Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge, all of the newly proposed schemes that minimize the number of multiplications use those multiplications exclusively in S-boxes based on a power mapping that is typically (x^3) or (x^{-1}). Furthermore, most of those schemes rely on complex and resource-intensive linear layers to achieve a low multiplication count. In this paper, we present Ciminion, an encryption scheme minimizing the number of field multiplications in large binary or prime fields, while using a very lightweight linear layer. In contrast to other schemes that aim to minimize field multiplications in ( \mathbb {F}<em>{2^n} ) or ( \mathbb {F}</em>{p} ), Ciminion relies on the Toffoli gate to improve the non-linear diffusion of the overall design. In addition, we have tailored the primitive for the use in a Farfalle-like construction in order to minimize the number of rounds of the used primitive, and hence, the number of field multiplications as far as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The HADES design strategy combines the classical SPN construction with the Partial SPN (PSPN) construction, in which at every encryption round, the non-linear layer is applied to only a part of the state. In a HADES design, a middle layer that consists of PSPN rounds is surrounded by outer layers of SPN rounds. The security arguments of HADES with respect to statistical attacks use only the SPN rounds, disregarding the PSPN rounds. This allows the designers to not pose any restriction on the MDS matrix used as the linear mixing operation.</p>
<p>In this paper we show that the choice of the MDS matrix significantly affects the security level provided by HADES designs. If the MDS is chosen properly, then the security level of the scheme against differential and linear attacks is significantly higher than claimed by the designers. On the other hand, weaker choices of the MDS allow for extremely large invariant subspaces that pass the entire middle layer without activating any non-linear operation (a.k.a. S-box).</p>
<p>We showcase our results on the Starkad and Poseidon instantiations of HADES. For Poseidon, we significantly improve the lower bounds on the number of active S-boxes with respect to both differential and linear cryptanalysis provided by the designers ‚Äì for example, from 28 to 60 active S-boxes for the (t=6) variant. For Starkad, we show that for any variant with t (i.e., the number of S-boxes in each round) divisible by 4, the cipher admits a huge invariant subspace that passes any number of PSPN rounds without activating any S-box (e.g., a subspace of size (2^{1134}) for the (t=24) variant). Furthermore, for various choices of the parameters, this invariant subspace can be used to mount a preimage attack on the hash function that breakes its security claims. On the other hand, we show that the problem can be fixed easily by replacing t with any value that is not divisible by four.</p>
<p>Following our paper, the designers of Starkad and Poseidon amended their design, by adding requirements which ensure that the MDS matrix is chosen properly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does the cryptanalytic effort needed to compromise t out of m instances of hashed passwords scale with the number of users when arbitrary preprocessing information on the hash function is available? We provide a formal treatment of this problem in the multi-instance setting with auxiliary information. A central contribution of our work is an (arguably simple) transcript-counting argument that allows us to resolve a fundamental question left open by Bellare, Ristenpart, and Tessaro (BRT; CRYPTO 2012) in multi-instance security. We leverage this proof technique to formally justify unrecoverability of hashed salted passwords in the presence of auxiliary information in the random-oracle model. To this end we utilize the recent pre-sampling techniques for dealing with auxiliary information developed by Coretti et al. (CRYPTO 2018). Our bounds closely match those commonly assumed in practice.</p>
<p>Besides hashing of passwords through a monolithic random oracle, we consider the effect of iteration, a technique that is used in classical mechanisms, such as bcrypt and PBKDF2, to slow down the rate of guessing. Building on the work of BRT, we formulate a notion of KDF security, also in the presence of auxiliary information, and prove an appropriate composition theorem for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We revisit the classical problem of designing optimally efficient cryptographically secure hash functions. Hash functions are traditionally designed via applying modes of operation on primitives with smaller domains. The results of Shrimpton and Stam (ICALP 2008), Rogaway and Steinberger (CRYPTO 2008), and Mennink and Preneel (CRYPTO 2012) show how to achieve optimally efficient designs of 2n-to-n-bit compression functions from non-compressing primitives with asymptotically optimal (2^{n/2-\epsilon })-query collision resistance. Designing optimally efficient and secure hash functions for larger domains (({&gt;}{2n}) bits) is still an open problem.</p>
<p>To enable efficiency analysis and comparison across hash functions built from primitives of different domain sizes, in this work we propose the new compactness efficiency notion. It allows us to focus on asymptotically optimally collision resistant hash function and normalize their parameters based on Stam‚Äôs bound from CRYPTO 2008 to obtain maximal efficiency.</p>
<p>We then present two tree-based modes of operation as a design principle for compact, large domain, fixed-input-length hash functions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Our first construction is an Augmented Binary Tree (ABR) mode. The design is a ((2^{\ell }+2^{\ell -1} -1)n)-to-n-bit hash function making a total of ((2^{\ell }-1)) calls to 2n-to-n-bit compression functions for any (\ell \ge 2). Our construction is optimally compact with asymptotically (optimal) (2^{n/2-\epsilon })-query collision resistance in the ideal model. For a tree of height (\ell ), in comparison with Merkle tree, the (\textsf {ABR}) mode processes additional ((2^{\ell -1}-1)) data blocks making the same number of internal compression function calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With our second design we focus our attention on the indifferentiability security notion. While the (\textsf {ABR}) mode achieves collision resistance, it fails to achieve indifferentiability from a random oracle within (2^{n/3}) queries. (\textsf {ABR}^{+}) compresses only 1 less data block than (\textsf {ABR}) with the same number of compression calls and achieves in addition indifferentiability up to (2^{n/2-\epsilon }) queries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of our designs are closely related to the ubiquitous Merkle Trees and have the potential for real-world applicability where the speed of hashing is of primary interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) schemes accept plaintexts from any finite set of values (such as social security numbers or birth dates) and produce ciphertexts that belong to the same set. They are extremely useful in practice since they make it possible to encrypt existing databases or communication packets without changing their format. Due to industry demand, NIST had standardized in 2016 two such encryption schemes called FF1 and FF3. They immediately attracted considerable cryptanalytic attention with decreasing attack complexities. The best currently known attack on the Feistel construction FF3 has data and memory complexity of ({O}(N^{11/6})) and time complexity of ({O}(N^{17/6})), where the input belongs to a domain of size (N \times N).</p>
<p>In this paper, we present and experimentally verify three improved attacks on FF3. Our best attack achieves the tradeoff curve (D=M=\tilde{O}(N^{2-t})), (T=\tilde{O}(N^{2+t})) for all (t \le 0.5). In particular, we can reduce the data and memory complexities to the more practical (\tilde{O}(N^{1.5})), and at the same time, reduce the time complexity to (\tilde{O}(N^{2.5})).</p>
<p>We also identify another attack vector against FPE schemes, the related-domain attack. We show how one can mount powerful attacks when the adversary is given access to the encryption under the same key in different domains, and show how to apply it to efficiently distinguish FF3 and FF3-1 instances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper presents the first publicly available cryptanalytic attacks on the GEA-1 and GEA-2 algorithms. Instead of providing full 64-bit security, we show that the initial state of GEA-1 can be recovered from as little as 65 bits of known keystream (with at least 24 bits coming from one frame) in time (2^{40}) GEA-1 evaluations and using 44.5 GiB of memory.</p>
<p>The attack on GEA-1 is based on an exceptional interaction of the deployed LFSRs and the key initialization, which is highly unlikely to occur by chance. This unusual pattern indicates that the weakness is intentionally hidden to limit the security level to 40 bit by design.</p>
<p>In contrast, for GEA-2 we did not discover the same intentional weakness. However, using a combination of algebraic techniques and list merging algorithms we are still able to break GEA-2 in time (2^{45.1}) GEA-2 evaluations. The main practical hurdle is the required knowledge of 1600 bytes of keystream.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let (E_a/ \mathbb {F}<em>{2}: y^2+xy=x^3+ax^2+1) be a Koblitz curve. The window (\tau )-adic non-adjacent form (window (\tau )NAF) is currently the standard representation system to perform scalar multiplications on (E_a/ \mathbb {F}</em>{2^m}) utilizing the Frobenius map (\tau ). This work focuses on the pre-computation part of scalar multiplication. We first introduce (\mu \bar{\tau })-operations where (\mu =(-1)^{1-a}) and (\bar{\tau }) is the complex conjugate of (\tau ). Efficient formulas of (\mu \bar{\tau })-operations are then derived and used in a novel pre-computation scheme. Our pre-computation scheme requires 6M(\,+\,6)S, 18M(\,+\,17)S, 44M(\,+\,32)S, and 88M(\,+\,62)S ((a=0)) and 6M(\,+\,6)S, 19M(\,+\,17)S, 46M(\,+\,32)S, and 90M(\,+\,62)S ((a=1)) for window (\tau )NAF with widths from 4 to 7 respectively. It is about two times faster, compared to the state-of-the-art technique of pre-computation in the literature. The impact of our new efficient pre-computation is also reflected by the significant improvement of scalar multiplication. Traditionally, window (\tau )NAF with width at most 6 is used to achieve the best scalar multiplication. Because of the dramatic cost reduction of the proposed pre-computation, we are able to increase the width for window (\tau )NAF to 7 for a better scalar multiplication. This indicates that the pre-computation part becomes more important in performing scalar multiplication. With our efficient pre-computation and the new window width, our scalar multiplication runs in at least 85.2% the time of Kohel‚Äôs work (Eurocrypt‚Äô2017) combining the best previous pre-computation. Our results push the scalar multiplication of Koblitz curves, a very well-studied and long-standing research area, to a significant new stage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At CHES 2016, Bos et al. showed that most of existing white-box implementations are easily broken by standard side-channel attacks. A natural idea to apply the well-developed side-channel countermeasure - linear masking schemes - leaves implementations vulnerable to linear algebraic attacks which exploit absence of noise in the white-box setting and are applicable for any order of linear masking. At ASIACRYPT 2018, Biryukov and Udovenko proposed a security model (BU-model for short) for protection against linear algebraic attacks and a new quadratic masking scheme which is provably secure in this model. However, countermeasures against higher-degree attacks were left as an open problem.</p>
<p>In this work, we study the effectiveness of another well-known side-channel countermeasure - shuffling - against linear and higher-degree algebraic attacks in the white-box setting. First, we extend the classic shuffling to include dummy computation slots and show that this is a crucial component for protecting against the algebraic attacks. We quantify and prove the security of dummy shuffling against the linear algebraic attack in the BU-model. We introduce a refreshing technique for dummy shuffling and show that it allows to achieve close to optimal protection in the model for arbitrary degrees of the attack, thus solving the open problem of protection against the algebraic attack in the BU-model. Furthermore, we describe an interesting proof-of-concept construction that makes the slot function public (while keeping the shuffling indexes private).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We revisit the matrix model for non-interference (NI) probing security of masking gadgets introduced by Bela√Ød et al. at CRYPTO 2017. This leads to two main results.</p>
<p>1) We generalise the theorems on which this model is based, so as to be able to apply them to masking schemes over any finite field‚Äîin particular (\mathbb {F}_2)‚Äîand to be able to analyse the strong non-interference (SNI) security notion. We also follow Faust et al. (TCHES 2018) to additionally consider a robust probing model that takes hardware defects such as glitches into account.</p>
<p>2) We exploit this improved model to implement a very efficient verification algorithm that improves the performance of state-of-the-art software by three orders of magnitude. We show applications to variants of NI and SNI multiplication gadgets from Barthe et al. (EUROCRYPT 2017) which we verify to be secure up to order 11 after a significant parallel computation effort, whereas the previous largest proven order was 7; SNI refreshing gadgets (ibid.); and NI multiplication gadgets from Gro√ü et al. (TIS@CCS 2016) secure in presence of glitches. We also reduce the randomness cost of some existing gadgets, notably for the implementation-friendly case of 8 shares, improving here the previous best results by 17% (resp. 19%) for SNI multiplication (resp. refreshing).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The random probing model is a leakage model in which each wire of a circuit leaks with a given probability p. This model enjoys practical relevance thanks to a reduction to the noisy leakage model, which is admitted as the right formalization for power and electromagnetic side-channel attacks. In addition, the random probing model is much more convenient than the noisy leakage model to prove the security of masking schemes. In a recent work, Ananth, Ishai, and Sahai (CRYPTO 2018) introduce a nice expansion strategy to construct random probing secure circuits. Their construction tolerates a leakage probability of (2^{-26}), which is the first quantified achievable leakage probability in the random probing model. In a follow-up work, Bela√Ød, Coron, Prouff, Rivain, and Taleb (CRYPTO 2020) generalize their idea and put forward a complete and practical framework to generate random probing secure circuits. The so-called expanding compiler can bootstrap simple base gadgets as long as they satisfy a new security notion called random probing expandability (RPE). They further provide an instantiation of the framework which tolerates a (2^{-8}) leakage probability in complexity (\mathcal {O}(\kappa ^{7.5})) where (\kappa ) denotes the security parameter.</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the RPE security notion. We exhibit the first upper bounds for the main parameter of a RPE gadget, which is known as the amplification order. We further show that the RPE notion can be made tighter and we exhibit strong connections between RPE and the strong non-interference (SNI) composition notion. We then introduce the first generic constructions of gadgets achieving RPE for any number of shares and with nearly optimal amplification orders and provide an asymptotic analysis of such constructions. Last but not least, we introduce new concrete constructions of small gadgets achieving maximal amplification orders. This allows us to obtain much more efficient instantiations of the expanding compiler: we obtain a complexity of (\mathcal {O}(\kappa ^{3.9})) for a slightly better leakage probability, as well as (\mathcal {O}(\kappa ^{3.2})) for a slightly lower leakage probability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Efficient Reed-Solomon code reconstruction algorithms, for example, by Guruswami and Wootters (STOC‚Äì2016), translate into local leakage attacks on Shamir secret-sharing schemes over characteristic-2 fields. However, Benhamouda, Degwekar, Ishai, and Rabin (CRYPTO‚Äì2018) showed that the Shamir secret sharing scheme over prime-fields is leakage resilient to one-bit local leakage if the reconstruction threshold is roughly 0.87 times the total number of parties. In several application scenarios, like secure multi-party multiplication, the reconstruction threshold must be at most half the number of parties. Furthermore, the number of leakage bits that the Shamir secret sharing scheme is resilient to is also unclear.</p>
<p>Towards this objective, we study the Shamir secret-sharing scheme‚Äôs leakage-resilience over a prime-field F. The parties‚Äô secret-shares, which are elements in the finite field F, are naturally represented as (\lambda )-bit binary strings representing the elements ({0,1,\dotsc ,p-1}). In our leakage model, the adversary can independently probe m bit-locations from each secret share. The inspiration for considering this leakage model stems from the impact that the study of oblivious transfer combiners had on general correlation extraction algorithms, and the significant influence of protecting circuits from probing attacks has on leakage-resilient secure computation.</p>
<p>Consider arbitrary reconstruction threshold (k\geqslant 2), physical bit-leakage parameter (m\geqslant 1), and the number of parties (n\geqslant 1). We prove that Shamir‚Äôs secret-sharing scheme with random evaluation places is leakage-resilient with high probability when the order of the field F is sufficiently large; ignoring polylogarithmic factors, one needs to ensure that (\log \left|F \right| \geqslant n/k). Our result, excluding polylogarithmic factors, states that Shamir‚Äôs scheme is secure as long as the total amount of leakage (m\cdot n) is less than the entropy (k\cdot \lambda ) introduced by the Shamir secret-sharing scheme. Note that our result holds even for small constant values of the reconstruction threshold k, which is essential to several application scenarios.</p>
<p>To complement this positive result, we present a physical-bit leakage attack for (m=1) physical bit-leakage from (n=k) secret shares and any prime-field F satisfying (\left|F \right|=1\mod k). In particular, there are (roughly) (\left|F \right|^{n-k+1}) such vulnerable choices for the n-tuple of evaluation places. We lower-bound the advantage of this attack for small values of the reconstruction threshold, like (k=2) and (k=3), and any (\left|F \right|=1\mod k). In general, we present a formula calculating our attack‚Äôs advantage for every k as (\left|F \right|\rightarrow \infty .)</p>
<p>Technically, our positive result relies on Fourier analysis, analytic properties of proper rank-r generalized arithmetic progressions, and B√©zout ‚Äôs theorem to bound the number of solutions to an equation over finite fields. The analysis of our attack relies on determining the ‚Äúdiscrepancy‚Äù of the Irwin-Hall distribution. A probability distribution‚Äôs discrepancy is a new property of distributions that our work introduces, which is of potential independent interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Side-channel attacks are a threat to secrets stored on a device, especially if an adversary has physical access to the device. As an effect of this, countermeasures against such attacks for cryptographic algorithms are a well-researched topic. In this work, we deviate from the study of cryptographic algorithms and instead focus on the side-channel protection of a much more basic operation, the comparison of a known attacker-controlled value with a secret one. Comparisons sensitive to side-channel leakage occur in tag comparisons during the verification of message authentication codes (MACs) or authenticated encryption, but are typically omitted in security analyses. Besides, also comparisons performed as part of fault countermeasures might be sensitive to side-channel attacks. In this work, we present a formal analysis on comparing values in a leakage resilient manner by utilizing cryptographic building blocks that are typically part of an implementation anyway. Our results indicate that there is no need to invest additional resources into implementing a protected comparison operation itself if a sufficiently protected implementation of a public cryptographic permutation, or a (tweakable) block cipher, is already available. We complement our contribution by applying our findings to the SuKS message authentication code used by lightweight authenticated encryption scheme ISAP, and to the classical Hash-then-PRF construction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We show that the most common flavors of noisy leakage can be simulated in the information-theoretic setting using a single query of bounded leakage, up to a small statistical simulation error and a slight loss in the leakage parameter. The latter holds true in particular for one of the most used noisy-leakage models, where the noisiness is measured using the conditional average min-entropy (Naor and Segev, CRYPTO‚Äô09 and SICOMP‚Äô12).</p>
<p>Our reductions between noisy and bounded leakage are achieved in two steps. First, we put forward a new leakage model (dubbed the dense leakage model) and prove that dense leakage can be simulated in the information-theoretic setting using a single query of bounded leakage, up to small statistical distance. Second, we show that the most common noisy-leakage models fall within the class of dense leakage, with good parameters. Third, we prove lower bounds on the amount of bounded leakage required for simulation with sub-constant error, showing that our reductions are nearly optimal. In particular, our results imply that useful general simulation of noisy leakage based on statistical distance and mutual information is impossible. We also provide a complete picture of the relationships between different noisy-leakage models.</p>
<p>Our result finds applications to leakage-resilient cryptography, where we are often able to lift security in the presence of bounded leakage to security in the presence of noisy leakage, both in the information-theoretic and in the computational setting. Additionally, we show how to use lower bounds in communication complexity to prove that bounded-collusion protocols (Kumar, Meka, and Sahai, FOCS‚Äô19) for certain functions do not only require long transcripts, but also necessarily need to reveal enough information about the inputs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Code-based public-key cryptosystems are promising candidates for standardization as quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms. Their security is based on the hardness of the syndrome decoding problem. Computing the syndrome in a finite field, usually (\mathbb {F}_{2}), guarantees the security of the constructions. We show in this article that the problem becomes considerably easier to solve if the syndrome is computed in (\mathbb {N}) instead. By means of laser fault injection, we illustrate how to compute the matrix-vector product in (\mathbb {N}) by corrupting specific instructions, and validate it experimentally. To solve the syndrome decoding problem in (\mathbb {N}), we propose a reduction to an integer linear programming problem. We leverage the computational efficiency of linear programming solvers to obtain real-time message recovery attacks against the code-based proposal to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization challenge. We perform our attacks in the worst-case scenario, i.e. considering random binary codes, and retrieve the initial message within minutes on a desktop computer.</p>
<p>Our attack targets the reference implementation of the Niederreiter cryptosystem in the NIST PQC competition finalist Classic McEliece and is practically feasible for all proposed parameters sets of this submission. For example, for the 256-bit security parameters sets, we successfully recover the message in a couple of seconds on a desktop computer Finally, we highlight the fact that the attack is still possible if only a fraction of the syndrome entries are faulty. This makes the attack feasible even though the fault injection does not have perfect repeatability and reduces the computational complexity of the attack, making it even more practical overall.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We introduce a natural generalization of two-source non-malleable extractors (Cheragachi and Guruswami, TCC 2014) called as multi-source non-malleable extractors. Multi-source non-malleable extractors are special independent source extractors which satisfy an additional non-malleability property. This property requires that the output of the extractor remains close to uniform even conditioned on its output generated by tampering several sources together. We formally define this primitive, give a construction that is secure against a wide class of tampering functions, and provide applications. More specifically, we obtain the following results:</p>
<p>For any (s \ge 2), we give an explicit construction of a s-source non-malleable extractor for min-entropy (\varOmega (n)) and error (2^{-n^{\varOmega (1)}}) in the overlapping joint tampering model. This means that each tampered source could depend on any strict subset of all the sources and the sets corresponding to each tampered source could be overlapping in a way that we define. Prior to our work, there were no known explicit constructions that were secure even against disjoint tampering (where the sets are required to be disjoint without any overlap).</p>
<p>We adapt the techniques used in the above construction to give a t-out-of-n non-malleable secret sharing scheme (Goyal and Kumar, STOC 2018) for any (t \le n) in the disjoint tampering model. This is the first general construction of a threshold non-malleable secret sharing (NMSS) scheme in the disjoint tampering model. All prior constructions had a restriction that the size of the tampered subsets could not be equal.</p>
<p>We further adapt the techniques used in the above construction to give a t-out-of-n non-malleable secret sharing scheme (Goyal and Kumar, STOC 2018) for any (t \le n) in the overlapping joint tampering model. This is the first construction of a threshold NMSS in the overlapping joint tampering model.</p>
<p>We show that a stronger notion of s-source non-malleable extractor that is multi-tamperable against disjoint tampering functions gives a single round network extractor protocol (Kalai et al., FOCS 2008) with attractive features. Plugging in with a new construction of multi-tamperable, 2-source non-malleable extractors provided in our work, we get a network extractor protocol for min-entropy (\varOmega (n)) that tolerates an optimum number ((t = p-2)) of faulty processors and extracts random bits for every honest processor. The prior network extractor protocols could only tolerate (t = \varOmega (p)) faulty processors and failed to extract uniform random bits for a fraction of the honest processors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Formulating cryptographic definitions to protect against software piracy is an important research direction that has not received much attention. Since natural definitions using classical cryptography are impossible to achieve (as classical programs can always be copied), this directs us towards using techniques from quantum computing. The seminal work of Aaronson [CCC‚Äô09] introduced the notion of quantum copy-protection precisely to address the problem of software anti-piracy. However, despite being one of the most important problems in quantum cryptography, there are no provably secure solutions of quantum copy-protection known for any class of functions.</p>
<p>We formulate an alternative definition for tackling software piracy, called secure software leasing (SSL). While weaker than quantum copy-protection, SSL is still meaningful and has interesting applications in software anti-piracy.</p>
<p>We present a construction of SSL for a subclass of evasive circuits (that includes natural implementations of point functions, conjunctions with wild cards, and affine testers) based on concrete cryptographic assumptions. Our construction is the first provably secure solution, based on concrete cryptographic assumptions, for software anti-piracy. To complement our positive result, we show, based on cryptographic assumptions, that there is a class of quantum unlearnable functions for which SSL does not exist. In particular, our impossibility result also rules out quantum copy-protection [Aaronson CCC‚Äô09] for an arbitrary class of quantum unlearnable functions; resolving an important open problem on the possibility of constructing copy-protection for arbitrary quantum unlearnable circuits.</p>

<p>Quantum lightning is a new cryptographic object that gives a strong form of quantum money. Zhandry recently defined quantum lightning and proposed a construction of it based on superpositions of low-rank matrices. The scheme is unusual, so it is difficult to base the scheme‚Äôs security on any widespread computational assumptions. Instead, Zhandry proposed a new hardness assumption that, if true, could be used to prove security.</p>
<p>In this work, we show that Zhandry‚Äôs hardness assumption is in fact false, so the proof of security does not hold. However, we note that the proposal for quantum lightning has not been proven insecure. This work is the first step in analyzing the security of [3]‚Äôs proposal and moving toward a scheme that we can prove to be secure.</p>

<p>In this paper, we study relationship between security of cryptographic schemes in the random oracle model (ROM) and quantum random oracle model (QROM). First, we introduce a notion of a proof of quantum access to a random oracle (PoQRO), which is a protocol to prove the capability to quantumly access a random oracle to a classical verifier. We observe that a proof of quantumness recently proposed by Brakerski et al. (TQC ‚Äô20) can be seen as a PoQRO. We also give a construction of a publicly verifiable PoQRO relative to a classical oracle. Based on them, we construct digital signature and public key encryption schemes that are secure in the ROM but insecure in the QROM. In particular, we obtain the first examples of natural cryptographic schemes that separate the ROM and QROM under a standard cryptographic assumption.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we give lifting theorems from security in the ROM to that in the QROM for certain types of cryptographic schemes and security notions. For example, our lifting theorems are applicable to Fiat-Shamir non-interactive arguments, Fiat-Shamir signatures, and Full-Domain-Hash signatures etc. We also discuss applications of our lifting theorems to quantum query complexity.</p>

To start off with, we offer a concise exposition of the technique, which easily extends to the parallel-query QROM, where in each query-round the considered algorithm may make several queries to the QROM in parallel. This variant of the QROM allows for a more fine-grained query-complexity analysis.</p>
<p>Our main technical contribution is a framework that simplifies the use of (the parallel-query generalization of) the compressed oracle technique for proving query complexity results. With our framework in place, whenever applicable, it is possible to prove quantum query complexity lower bounds by means of purely classical reasoning. More than that, for typical examples the crucial classical observations that give rise to the classical bounds are sufficient to conclude the corresponding quantum bounds.</p>
<p>We demonstrate this on a few examples, recovering known results but also obtaining new results. Our main target is the hardness of finding a q-chain with fewer than q parallel queries, i.e., a sequence (x_0, x_1,\ldots , x_q) with (x_i = H(x_{i-1})) for all (1 \le i \le q).</p>
<p>The above problem of finding a hash chain is of fundamental importance in the context of proofs of sequential work. Indeed, as a concrete cryptographic application of our techniques, we prove quantum security of the ‚ÄúSimple Proofs of Sequential Work‚Äù by Cohen and Pietrzak .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We define the notion of a proof of knowledge in the setting where the verifier is classical, but the prover is quantum, and where the witness that the prover holds is in general a quantum state. We establish simple properties of our definition, including that, if a nondestructive classical proof of quantum knowledge exists for some state, then that state can be cloned by an unbounded adversary, and that, under certain conditions on the parameters in our definition, a proof of knowledge protocol for a hard-to-clone state can be used as a (destructive) quantum money verification protocol. In addition, we provide two examples of protocols (both inspired by private-key classical verification protocols for quantum money schemes) which we can show to be proofs of quantum knowledge under our definition. In so doing, we introduce techniques for the analysis of such protocols which build on results from the literature on nonlocal games. Finally, we show that, under our definition, the verification protocol introduced by Mahadev (FOCS 2018) is a classical argument of quantum knowledge for QMA relations. In all cases, we construct an explicit quantum extractor that is able to produce a quantum witness given black-box quantum (rewinding) access to the prover, the latter of which includes the ability to coherently execute the prover‚Äôs black-box circuit controlled on a superposition of messages from the verifier.</p>

<p>Running secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols with hundreds or thousands of players would allow leveraging large volunteer networks (such as blockchains and Tor) and help justify honest majority assumptions. However, most existing protocols have at least a linear (multiplicative) dependence on the number of players, making scaling difficult. Known protocols with asymptotic efficiency independent of the number of parties (excluding additive factors) require expensive circuit transformations that induce large overheads.</p>
<p>We observe that the circuits used in many important applications of MPC such as training algorithms used to create machine learning models have a highly repetitive structure. We formalize this class of circuits and propose an MPC protocol that achieves (O(|\mathsf {C}|)) total complexity for this class. We implement our protocol and show that it is practical and outperforms (O(n|\mathsf {C}|)) protocols for modest numbers of players.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows multiple parties to perform secure joint computations on their private inputs. Today, applications for MPC are growing with thousands of parties wishing to build federated machine learning models or trusted setups for blockchains. To address such scenarios we propose a suite of novel MPC protocols that maximize throughput when run with large numbers of parties. In particular, our protocols have both communication and computation complexity that decrease with the number of parties. Our protocols buildon prior protocolsbased on packed secret-sharing, introducing new techniques to build more efficient computation for general circuits. Specifically, we introduce a new approach for handling linear attacks that arise in protocols using packed secret-sharing and we propose a method for unpacking shared multiplication triples without increasing the asymptotic costs. Compared with prior work, we avoid the (\log |C|) overhead required when generically compiling circuits of size |C| for use in a SIMD computation, and we improve over folklore ‚Äúcommittee-based‚Äù solutions by a factor of O(s), the statistical security parameter. In practice, our protocol is up to 10X faster than any known construction, under a reasonable set of parameters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Motivated by the goal of designing versatile and flexible secure computation protocols that at the same time require as little interaction as possible, we present new multiparty reusable Non-Interactive Secure Computation (mrNISC) protocols. This notion, recently introduced by Benhamouda and Lin (TCC 2020), is essentially two-round Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols where the first round of messages serves as a reusable commitment to the private inputs of participating parties. Using these commitments, any subset of parties can later compute any function of their choice on their respective inputs by just sending a single message to a stateless evaluator, conveying the result of the computation but nothing else. Importantly, the input commitments can be computed without knowing anything about other participating parties (neither their identities nor their number) and they are reusable across any number of desired computations.</p>
<p>We give a construction of mrNISC that achieves standard simulation security, as classical multi-round MPC protocols achieve. Our construction relies on the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption with polynomial modulus, and on the existence of a pseudorandom function (PRF) in (\mathsf {NC}^1). We achieve semi-malicious security in the plain model and malicious security by further relying on trusted setup (which is unavoidable for mrNISC). In comparison, the only previously known constructions of mrNISC were either using bilinear maps or using strong primitives such as program obfuscation.</p>
<p>We use our mrNISC to obtain new Multi-Key FHE (MKFHE) schemes with threshold decryption:</p>
<p>In the CRS model, we obtain threshold MKFHE for (\mathrm {NC}^1 ) based on LWE with only polynomial modulus and PRFs in (\mathsf {NC}^1), whereas all previous constructions rely on LWE with super-polynomial modulus-to-noise ratio.</p>
<p>In the plain model, we obtain threshold levelled MKFHE for (\mathrm {P} ) based on LsWE with polynomial modulus, PRF in (\mathrm {NC}^1 ), and NTRU, and another scheme for constant number of parties from LWE with sub-exponential modulus-to-noise ratio. The only known prior construction of threshold MKFHE (Ananth et al., TCC 2020) in the plain model restricts the set of parties who can compute together at the onset.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We consider the problem of round-optimal unbounded MPC: in the first round, parties publish a message that depends only on their input. In the second round, any subset of parties can jointly and securely compute any function f over their inputs in a single round of broadcast. We do not impose any a-priori bound on the number of parties nor on the size of the functions that can be computed.</p>
<p>Our main result is a semi-honest two-round protocol for unbounded MPC in the plain model from the hardness of the standard learning with errors (LWE) problem. Prior work in the same setting assumes the hardness of problems over bilinear maps. Thus, our protocol is the first example of unbounded MPC that is post-quantum secure.</p>
<p>The central ingredient of our protocol is a new scheme of attribute-based secure function evaluation (AB-SFE) with public decryption. Our construction combines techniques from the realm of homomorphic commitments with delegation of lattice basis. We believe that such a scheme may find further applications in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Covert security has been introduced as a compromise between semi-honest and malicious security. In a nutshell, covert security guarantees that malicious behavior can be detected by the honest parties with some probability, but in case detection fails all bets are off. While the security guarantee offered by covert security is weaker than full-fledged malicious security, it comes with significantly improved efficiency. An important extension of covert security introduced by Asharov and Orlandi (ASIACRYPT‚Äô12) is public verifiability, which allows the honest parties to create a publicly verifiable certificate of malicious behavior. Public verifiability significantly strengthen covert security as the certificate allows punishment via an external party, e.g., a judge.</p>
<p>Most previous work on publicly verifiable covert (PVC) security focuses on the two-party case, and the multi-party case has mostly been neglected. In this work, we introduce a novel compiler for multi-party PVC secure protocols with no private inputs. The class of supported protocols includes the preprocessing of common multi-party computation protocols that are designed in the offline-online model. Our compiler leverages time-lock encryption to offer high probability of cheating detection (often also called deterrence factor) independent of the number of involved parties. Moreover, in contrast to the only earlier work that studies PVC in the multi-party setting (CRYPTO‚Äô20), we provide the first full formal security analysis.</p>

<p>We study the communication complexity of unconditionally secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols in the honest majority setting. Despite tremendous efforts in achieving efficient protocols for binary fields under computational assumptions, there are no efficient unconditional MPC protocols in this setting. In particular, there are no n-party protocols with constant overhead admitting communication complexity of O(n) bits per gate. Cascudo, Cramer, Xing and Yuan (CRYPTO 2018) were the first ones to achieve such an overhead in the amortized setting by evaluating (O(\log n)) copies of the same circuit in the binary field in parallel. In this work, we construct the first unconditional MPC protocol secure against a malicious adversary in the honest majority setting evaluating just a single boolean circuit with amortized communication complexity of O(n) bits per gate.</p>

<p>In this work we introduce a new (circuit-dependent) homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) scheme for all (\log /\log \log )-local circuits, with communication proportional only to the width of the circuit, and polynomial computation, assuming the super-polynomial hardness of learning parity with noise ((\mathsf {LPN})). At the heart of our new construction is a pseudorandom correlation generator (PCG), which allows two partie to locally stretch, from short seeds, pseudorandom instances of an arbitrary (\log /\log \log )-local additive correlation.</p>
<p>Our main application, and the main motivation behind this work, is a generic two-party secure computation protocol for every layered (boolean or arithmetic) circuit of size s with total communication (O(s/\log \log s)) and polynomial computation, assuming the super-polynomial hardness of the standard learning parity with noise assumption (a circuit is layered if its nodes can be partitioned in layers, such that any wire connects adjacent layers). This expands the set of assumptions under which the ‚Äòcircuit size barrier‚Äô can be broken, for a large class of circuits. The strength of the underlying assumption is tied to the sublinearity factor: we achieve communication O(s/k(s)) under the (s^{2^{k(s)}})-hardness of LPN, for any (k(s) \le \log \log s / 4).</p>
<p>Previously, the set of assumptions known to imply a PCG for correlations of degree (\omega (1)) or generic secure computation protocols with sublinear communication was restricted to LWE, DDH, and a circularly secure variant of DCR.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boyle et al. (TCC 2019) proposed a new approach for secure computation in the preprocessing model building on function secret sharing (FSS), where a gate g is evaluated using an FSS scheme for the related offset family (g_r(x)=g(x+r)). They further presented efficient FSS schemes based on any pseudorandom generator (PRG) for the offset families of several useful gates g that arise in ‚Äúmixed-mode‚Äù secure computation. These include gates for zero test, integer comparison, ReLU, and spline functions. The FSS-based approach offers significant savings in online communication and round complexity compared to alternative techniques based on garbled circuits or secret sharing.</p>
<p>In this work, we improve and extend the previous results of Boyle et al. by making the following three kinds of contributions:</p>
<p>Improved Key Size. The preprocessing and storage costs of the FSS-based approach directly depend on the FSS key size. We improve the key size of previous constructions through two steps. First, we obtain roughly (4\times ) reduction in key size for Distributed Comparison Function (DCF), i.e., FSS for the family of functions (f^{&lt;}_{\alpha ,\beta }(x)) that output (\beta ) if (x &lt; \alpha ) and 0 otherwise. DCF serves as a central building block in the constructions of Boyle et al.. Second, we improve the number of DCF instances required for realizing useful gates g. For example, whereas previous FSS schemes for ReLU and m-piece spline required 2 and 2m DCF instances, respectively, ours require only a single instance of DCF in both cases. This improves the FSS key size by (6-22\times ) for commonly used gates such as ReLU and sigmoid.</p>
<p>New Gates. We present the first PRG-based FSS schemes for arithmetic and logical shift gates, as well as for bit-decomposition where both the input and outputs are shared over (\mathbb {Z}_{2^n}). These gates are crucial for many applications related to fixed-point arithmetic and machine learning.</p>
<p>A Barrier. The above results enable a 2-round PRG-based secure evaluation of ‚Äúmultiply-then-truncate,‚Äù a central operation in fixed-point arithmetic, by sequentially invoking FSS schemes for multiplication and shift. We identify a barrier to obtaining a 1-round implementation via a single FSS scheme, showing that this would require settling a major open problem in the area of FSS: namely, a PRG-based FSS for the class of bit-conjunction functions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this work we present a new construction for a batched Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) based on Vector-OLE and the PaXoS data structure. We then use it in the standard transformation for achieving Private Set Intersection (PSI) from an OPRF. Our overall construction is highly efficient with O(n) communication and computation. We demonstrate that our protocol can achieve malicious security at only a very small overhead compared to the semi-honest variant. For input sizes (n = 2^{20}), our malicious protocol needs 6.2 s and less than 59 MB communication. This corresponds to under 450 bits per element, which is the lowest number for any published PSI protocol (semi-honest or malicious) to date. Moreover, in theory our semi-honest (resp. malicious) protocol can achieve as low as 219 (resp. 260) bits per element for (n=2^{20}) at the added cost of interpolating a polynomial over n elements.</p>
<p>As a second contribution, we present an extension where the output of the PSI is secret-shared between the two parties. This functionality is generally referred to as Circuit-PSI. It allows the parties to perform a subsequent MPC protocol on the secret-shared outputs, e.g., train a machine learning model. Our circuit PSI protocol builds on our OPRF construction along with another application of the PaXoS data structure. It achieves semi-honest security and allows for a highly efficient implementation, up to 3x faster than previous work.</p>
