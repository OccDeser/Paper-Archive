<blockquote>
<p>It is convenient and common for schemes in the random oracle model to assume access to multiple random oracles (ROs), leaving to implementations the task‚Äîwe call it oracle cloning‚Äîof constructing them from a single RO. The first part of the paper is a case study of oracle cloning in KEM submissions to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process. We give key-recovery attacks on some submissions arising from mistakes in oracle cloning, and find other submissions using oracle cloning methods whose validity is unclear. Motivated by this, the second part of the paper gives a theoretical treatment of oracle cloning. We give a definition of what is an ‚Äúoracle cloning method‚Äù and what it means for such a method to ‚Äúwork,‚Äù in a framework we call read-only indifferentiability, a simple variant of classical indifferentiability that yields security not only for usage in single-stage games but also in multi-stage ones. We formalize domain separation, and specify and study many oracle cloning methods, including common domain-separating ones, giving some general results to justify (prove read-only indifferentiability of) certain classes of methods. We are not only able to validate the oracle cloning methods used in many of the unbroken NIST PQC KEMs, but also able to specify and validate oracle cloning methods that may be useful beyond that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We study the memory-tightness of security reductions in public-key cryptography, focusing in particular on Hashed ElGamal. We prove that any straightline (i.e., without rewinding) black-box reduction needs memory which grows linearly with the number of queries of the adversary it has access to, as long as this reduction treats the underlying group generically. This makes progress towards proving a conjecture by Auerbach et al. (CRYPTO 2017), and is also the first lower bound on memory-tightness for a concrete cryptographic scheme (as opposed to generalized reductions across security notions). Our proof relies on compression arguments in the generic group model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Schnorr blind signing protocol allows blind issuing of Schnorr signatures, one of the most widely used signatures. Despite its practical relevance, its security analysis is unsatisfactory. The only known security proof is informal and in the combination of the generic group model (GGM) and the random oracle model (ROM) assuming that the ‚ÄúROS problem‚Äù is hard. The situation is similar for (Schnorr-)signed ElGamal encryption, a simple CCA2-secure variant of ElGamal.</p>
<p>We analyze the security of these schemes in the algebraic group model (AGM), an idealized model closer to the standard model than the GGM. We first prove tight security of Schnorr signatures from the discrete logarithm assumption (DL) in the AGM+ROM. We then give a rigorous proof for blind Schnorr signatures in the AGM+ROM assuming hardness of the one-more discrete logarithm problem and ROS.</p>
<p>As ROS can be solved in sub-exponential time using Wagner‚Äôs algorithm, we propose a simple modification of the signing protocol, which leaves the signatures unchanged. It is therefore compatible with systems that already use Schnorr signatures, such as blockchain protocols. We show that the security of our modified scheme relies on the hardness of a problem related to ROS that appears much harder. Finally, we give tight reductions, again in the AGM+ROM, of the CCA2 security of signed ElGamal encryption to DDH and signed hashed ElGamal key encapsulation to DL.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We provide a standard-model implementation (of a relaxation) of the algebraic group model (AGM, [Fuchsbauer, Kiltz, Loss, CRYPTO 2018]). Specifically, we show that every algorithm that uses our group is algebraic, and hence ‚Äúmust know‚Äù a representation of its output group elements in terms of its input group elements. Here, ‚Äúmust know‚Äù means that a suitable extractor can extract such a representation efficiently. We stress that our implementation relies only on falsifiable assumptions in the standard model, and in particular does not use any knowledge assumptions.</p>
<p>As a consequence, our group allows to transport a number of results obtained in the AGM into the standard model, under falsifiable assumptions. For instance, we show that in our group, several Diffie-Hellman-like assumptions (including computational Diffie-Hellman) are equivalent to the discrete logarithm assumption. Furthermore, we show that our group allows to prove the Schnorr signature scheme tightly secure in the random oracle model.</p>
<p>Our construction relies on indistinguishability obfuscation, and hence should not be considered as a practical group itself. However, our results show that the AGM is a realistic computational model (since it can be instantiated in the standard model), and that results obtained in the AGM are also possible with standard-model groups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Traditional bounds on synchronous Byzantine agreement (BA) and secure multi-party computation (MPC) establish that in absence of a private correlated-randomness setup, such as a PKI, protocols can tolerate up to (t&lt;n/3) of the parties being malicious. The introduction of ‚ÄúNakamoto style‚Äù consensus, based on Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains, put forth a somewhat different flavor of BA, showing that even a majority of corrupted parties can be tolerated as long as the majority of the computation resources remain at honest hands. This assumption on honest majority of some resource was also extended to other resources such as stake, space, etc., upon which blockchains achieving Nakamoto-style consensus were built that violated the (t&lt;n/3) bound in terms of number of party corruptions. The above state of affairs begs the question of whether the seeming mismatch is due to different goals and models, or whether the resource-restricting paradigm can be generically used to circumvent the n/3 lower bound.</p>
<p>In this work we study this question and formally demonstrate how the above paradigm changes the rules of the game in cryptographic definitions. First, we abstract the core properties that the resource-restricting paradigm offers by means of a functionality wrapper, in the UC framework, which when applied to a standard point-to-point network restricts the ability (of the adversary) to send new messages. We show that such a wrapped network can be implemented using the resource-restricting paradigm‚Äîconcretely, using PoWs and honest majority of computing power‚Äîand that the traditional (t&lt;n/3) impossibility results fail when the parties have access to such a network. Our construction is in the fresh Common Reference String (CRS) model‚Äîi.e., it assumes a CRS which becomes available to the parties at the same time as to the adversary.</p>
<p>We then present constructions for BA and MPC, which given access to such a network tolerate (t&lt;n/2) corruptions without assuming a private correlated randomness setup. We also show how to remove the freshness assumption from the CRS by leveraging the power of a random oracle. Our MPC protocol achieves the standard notion of MPC security, where parties might have dedicated roles, as is for example the case in Oblivious Transfer protocols. This is in contrast to existing solutions basing MPC on PoWs, which associate roles to pseudonyms but do not link these pseudonyms with the actual parties.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We study the problem of almost-everywhere reliable message transmission; a key component in designing efficient and secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) protocols for sparsely connected networks. The goal is to design low-degree networks which allow a large fraction of honest nodes to communicate reliably even when a small constant fraction of nodes experience byzantine corruption and deviate arbitrarily from the assigned protocol.</p>
<p>In this paper, we achieve a (\log )-degree network with a polylogarithmic work complexity protocol, thereby improving over the state-of-the-art result of Chandran et al. (ICALP 2010) who required a polylogarithmic-degree network and had a linear work complexity. In addition, we also achieve:</p>
<p>A work efficient version of Dwork et al.‚Äôs (STOC 1986) butterfly network.</p>
<p>An improvement upon the state of the art protocol of Ben-or and Ron (Information Processing Letters 1996) in the randomized corruption model‚Äîboth in work-efficiency and in resilience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We construct the first actively-secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols with an arbitrary number of parties in the dishonest majority setting, for an arbitrary field (\mathbb {F}) with constant communication overhead over the ‚Äúpassive-GMW‚Äù protocol (Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson, STOC ‚Äò87). Our protocols rely on passive implementations of Oblivious Transfer (OT) in the boolean setting and Oblivious Linear function Evaluation (OLE) in the arithmetic setting. Previously, such protocols were only known over sufficiently large fields (Genkin et al. STOC ‚Äò14) or a constant number of parties (Ishai et al. CRYPTO ‚Äò08).</p>
<p>Conceptually, our protocols are obtained via a new compiler from a passively-secure protocol for a distributed multiplication functionality (\mathcal{F}<em>{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm {MULT}}), to an actively-secure protocol for general functionalities. Roughly, (\mathcal{F}</em>{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm {MULT}}) is parameterized by a linear-secret sharing scheme (\mathcal{S}), where it takes (\mathcal{S})-shares of two secrets and returns (\mathcal{S})-shares of their product.</p>
<p>We show that our compilation is concretely efficient for sufficiently large fields, resulting in an overhead of 2 when securely computing natural circuits. Our compiler has two additional benefits: (1) it can rely on any passive implementation of (\mathcal{F}_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm {MULT}}), which, besides the standard implementation based on OT (for boolean) and OLE (for arithmetic) allows us to rely on implementations based on threshold cryptosystems (Cramer et al. Eurocrypt ‚Äò01); and (2) it can rely on weaker-than-passive (i.e., imperfect/leaky) implementations, which in some parameter regimes yield actively-secure protocols with overhead less than 2.</p>
<p>Instantiating this compiler with an ‚Äúhonest-majority‚Äù implementations of (\mathcal{F}_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm {MULT}}), we obtain the first honest-majority protocol with optimal corruption threshold for boolean circuits with constant communication overhead over the best passive protocol (Damg√•rd and Nielsen, CRYPTO ‚Äò07).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We present the first maliciously secure protocol for succinct non-interactive secure two-party computation (SNISC): Each player sends just a single message whose length is (essentially) independent of the running time of the function to be computed. The protocol does not require any trusted setup, satisfies superpolynomial-time simulation-based security (SPS), and is based on (subexponential) security of the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption. We do not rely on SNARKs or ‚Äúknowledge of exponent‚Äù-type assumptions.</p>
<p>Since the protocol is non-interactive, the relaxation to SPS security is needed, as standard polynomial-time simulation is impossible; however, a slight variant of our main protocol yields a SNISC with polynomial-time simulation in the CRS model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this paper we spot light on dedicated quantum collision attacks on concrete hash functions, which has not received much attention so far. In the classical setting, the generic complexity to find collisions of an n-bit hash function is (O(2^{n/2})), thus classical collision attacks based on differential cryptanalysis such as rebound attacks build differential trails with probability higher than (2^{-n/2}). By the same analogy, generic quantum algorithms such as the BHT algorithm find collisions with complexity (O(2^{n/3})). With quantum algorithms, a pair of messages satisfying a differential trail with probability p can be generated with complexity (p^{-1/2}). Hence, in the quantum setting, some differential trails with probability up to (2^{-2n/3}) that cannot be exploited in the classical setting may be exploited to mount a collision attack in the quantum setting. In particular, the number of attacked rounds may increase. In this paper, we attack two international hash function standards: AES-MMO and Whirlpool. For AES-MMO, we present a 7-round differential trail with probability (2^{-80}) and use it to find collisions with a quantum version of the rebound attack, while only 6 rounds can be attacked in the classical setting. For Whirlpool, we mount a collision attack based on a 6-round differential trail from a classical rebound distinguisher with a complexity higher than the birthday bound. This improves the best classical attack on 5 rounds by 1. We also show that those trails are optimal in our approach. Our results have two important implications. First, there seems to exist a common belief that classically secure hash functions will remain secure against quantum adversaries. Indeed, several second-round candidates in the NIST post-quantum competition use existing hash functions, say SHA-3, as quantum secure ones. Our results disprove this common belief. Second, our observation suggests that differential trail search should not stop with probability (2^{-n/2}) but should consider up to (2^{-2n/3}). Hence it deserves to revisit the previous differential trail search activities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grover‚Äôs search algorithm gives a quantum attack against block ciphers by searching for a key that matches a small number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs. This attack uses (O(\sqrt{N})) calls to the cipher to search a key space of size N. Previous work in the specific case of AES derived the full gate cost by analyzing quantum circuits for the cipher, but focused on minimizing the number of qubits.</p>
<p>In contrast, we study the cost of quantum key search attacks under a depth restriction and introduce techniques that reduce the oracle depth, even if it requires more qubits. As cases in point, we design quantum circuits for the block ciphers AES and LowMC. Our circuits give a lower overall attack cost in both the gate count and depth-times-width cost models. In NIST‚Äôs post-quantum cryptography standardization process, security categories are defined based on the concrete cost of quantum key search against AES. We present new, lower cost estimates for each category, so our work has immediate implications for the security assessment of post-quantum cryptography.</p>
<p>As part of this work, we release Q# implementations of the full Grover oracle for AES-128, -192, -256 and for the three LowMC instantiations used in Picnic, including unit tests and code to reproduce our quantum resource estimates. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first two such full implementations and automatic resource estimations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The k-xor or Generalized Birthday Problem aims at finding, given k lists of bit-strings, a k-tuple among them XORing to 0. If the lists are unbounded, the best classical (exponential) time complexity has withstood since Wagner‚Äôs CRYPTO 2002 paper. If the lists are bounded (of the same size) and such that there is a single solution, the dissection algorithms of Dinur et al. (CRYPTO 2012) improve the memory usage over a simple meet-in-the-middle.</p>
<p>In this paper, we study quantum algorithms for the k-xor problem. With unbounded lists and quantum access, we improve previous work by Grassi et al. (ASIACRYPT 2018) for almost all k. Next, we extend our study to lists of any size and with classical access only.</p>
<p>We define a set of ‚Äúmerging trees‚Äù which represent the best known strategies for quantum and classical merging in k-xor algorithms, and prove that our method is optimal among these. Our complexities are confirmed by a Mixed Integer Linear Program that computes the best strategy for a given k-xor problem. All our algorithms apply also when considering modular additions instead of bitwise xors.</p>
<p>This framework enables us to give new improved quantum k-xor algorithms for all k and list sizes. Applications include the subset-sum problem, LPN with limited memory and the multiple-encryption problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) aims at capturing all problems that are susceptible to be solvable in quantum polynomial time following the blueprints of Shor‚Äôs celebrated algorithm. Successful solutions to this problems over various commutative groups allow to efficiently perform number-theoretic tasks such as factoring or finding discrete logarithms.</p>
<p>The latest successful generalization (Eisentr√§ger et al. STOC 2014) considers the problem of finding a full-rank lattice as the hidden subgroup of the continuous vector space (\mathbb {R}^m), even for large dimensions m. It unlocked new cryptanalytic algorithms (Biasse-Song SODA 2016, Cramer et al. EUROCRYPT 2016 and 2017), in particular to find mildly short vectors in ideal lattices.</p>
<p>The cryptanalytic relevance of such a problem raises the question of a more refined and quantitative complexity analysis. In the light of the increasing physical difficulty of maintaining a large entanglement of qubits, the degree of concern may be different whether the above algorithm requires only linearly many qubits or a much larger polynomial amount of qubits.</p>
<p>This is the question we start addressing with this work. We propose a detailed analysis of (a variation of) the aforementioned HSP algorithm, and conclude on its complexity as a function of all the relevant parameters. Our modular analysis is tailored to support the optimization of future specialization to cases of cryptanalytic interests. We suggest a few ideas in this direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The right of an individual to request the deletion of their personal data by an entity that might be storing it ‚Äì referred to as the right to be forgotten ‚Äì has been explicitly recognized, legislated, and exercised in several jurisdictions across the world, including the European Union, Argentina, and California. However, much of the discussion surrounding this right offers only an intuitive notion of what it means for it to be fulfilled ‚Äì of what it means for such personal data to be deleted.</p>
<p>In this work, we provide a formal definitional framework for the right to be forgotten using tools and paradigms from cryptography. In particular, we provide a precise definition of what could be (or should be) expected from an entity that collects individuals‚Äô data when a request is made of it to delete some of this data. Our framework captures most, though not all, relevant aspects of typical systems involved in data processing. While it cannot be viewed as expressing the statements of current laws (especially since these are rather vague in this respect), our work offers technically precise definitions that represent possibilities for what the law could reasonably expect, and alternatives for what future versions of the law could explicitly require.</p>
<p>Finally, with the goal of demonstrating the applicability of our framework and definitions, we consider various natural and simple scenarios where the right to be forgotten comes up. For each of these scenarios, we highlight the pitfalls that arise even in genuine attempts at implementing systems offering deletion guarantees, and also describe technological solutions that provably satisfy our definitions. These solutions bring together techniques built by various communities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oblivious RAM (ORAM), first introduced in the ground-breaking work of Goldreich and Ostrovsky (STOC ‚Äô87 and J. ACM ‚Äô96) is a technique for provably obfuscating programs‚Äô access patterns, such that the access patterns leak no information about the programs‚Äô secret inputs. To compile a general program to an oblivious counterpart, it is well-known that (\varOmega (\log N)) amortized blowup is necessary, where N is the size of the logical memory. This was shown in Goldreich and Ostrovksy‚Äôs original ORAM work for statistical security and in a somewhat restricted model (the so called balls-and-bins model), and recently by Larsen and Nielsen (CRYPTO ‚Äô18) for computational security.</p>
<p>A long standing open question is whether there exists an optimal ORAM construction that matches the aforementioned logarithmic lower bounds (without making large memory word assumptions, and assuming a constant number of CPU registers). In this paper, we resolve this problem and present the first secure ORAM with (O(\log N)) amortized blowup, assuming one-way functions. Our result is inspired by and non-trivially improves on the recent beautiful work of Patel et al. (FOCS ‚Äô18) who gave a construction with (O(\log N\cdot \log \log N)) amortized blowup, assuming one-way functions.</p>
<p>One of our building blocks of independent interest is a linear-time deterministic oblivious algorithm for tight compaction: Given an array of n elements where some elements are marked, we permute the elements in the array so that all marked elements end up in the front of the array. Our O(n) algorithm improves the previously best known deterministic or randomized algorithms whose running time is (O(n \cdot \log n)) or (O(n \cdot \log \log n)), respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An adversary with S bits of memory obtains a stream of Q elements that are uniformly drawn from the set ({1,2,\ldots ,N}), either with or without replacement. This corresponds to sampling Q elements using either a random function or a random permutation. The adversary‚Äôs goal is to distinguish between these two cases.</p>
<p>This problem was first considered by Jaeger and Tessaro (EUROCRYPT 2019), which proved that the adversary‚Äôs advantage is upper bounded by (\sqrt{Q \cdot S/N}). Jaeger and Tessaro used this bound as a streaming switching lemma which allowed proving that known time-memory tradeoff attacks on several modes of operation (such as counter-mode) are optimal up to a factor of (O(\log N)) if (Q \cdot S \approx N). However, the bound‚Äôs proof assumed an unproven combinatorial conjecture. Moreover, if (Q \cdot S \ll N) there is a gap between the upper bound of (\sqrt{Q \cdot S/N}) and the (Q \cdot S/N) advantage obtained by known attacks.</p>
<p>In this paper, we prove a tight upper bound (up to poly-logarithmic factors) of (O(\log Q \cdot Q \cdot S/N)) on the adversary‚Äôs advantage in the streaming distinguishing problem. The proof does not require a conjecture and is based on a hybrid argument that gives rise to a reduction from the unique-disjointness communication complexity problem to streaming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, Castryck, Lange, Martindale, Panny, and Renes proposed CSIDH (pronounced ‚Äúsea-side‚Äù) as a candidate post-quantum ‚Äúcommutative group action.‚Äù It has attracted much attention and interest, in part because it enables noninteractive Diffie‚ÄìHellman-like key exchange with quite small communication. Subsequently, CSIDH has also been used as a foundation for digital signatures.</p>
<p>In 2003‚Äì04, Kuperberg and then Regev gave asymptotically subexponential quantum algorithms for ‚Äúhidden shift‚Äù problems, which can be used to recover the CSIDH secret key from a public key. In late 2011, Kuperberg gave a follow-up quantum algorithm called the collimation sieve (‚Äúc-sieve‚Äù for short), which improves the prior ones, in particular by using exponentially less quantum memory and offering more parameter tradeoffs. While recent works have analyzed the concrete cost of the original algorithms (and variants) against CSIDH, nothing of this nature was previously available for the c-sieve.</p>
<p>This work fills that gap. Specifically, we generalize Kuperberg‚Äôs collimation sieve to work for arbitrary finite cyclic groups, provide some practical efficiency improvements, give a classical (i.e., non-quantum) simulator, run experiments for a wide range of parameters up to the actual CSIDH-512 group order, and concretely quantify the complexity of the c-sieve against CSIDH.</p>
<p>Our main conclusion is that the proposed CSIDH parameters provide relatively little quantum security beyond what is given by the cost of quantumly evaluating the CSIDH group action itself (on a uniform superposition). For example, the cost of CSIDH-512 key recovery is only about (2^{16}) quantum evaluations using (2^{40}) bits of quantumly accessible classical memory (plus relatively small other resources). This improves upon a prior estimate of (2^{32.5}) evaluations and (2^{31}) qubits of quantum memory, for a variant of Kuperberg‚Äôs original sieve.</p>
<p>Under the plausible assumption that quantum evaluation does not cost much more than what is given by a recent ‚Äúbest case‚Äù analysis, CSIDH-512 can therefore be broken using significantly less than (2^{64}) quantum T-gates. This strongly invalidates its claimed NIST level 1 quantum security, especially when accounting for the MAXDEPTH restriction. Moreover, under analogous assumptions for CSIDH-1024 and -1792, which target higher NIST security levels, except near the high end of the MAXDEPTH range even these instantiations fall short of level 1.</p>

<p>CSIDH is a recent proposal for post-quantum non-interactive key-exchange, based on supersingular elliptic curve isogenies. It is similar in design to a previous scheme by Couveignes, Rostovtsev and Stolbunov, but aims at an improved balance between efficiency and security. In the proposal, the authors suggest concrete parameters in order to meet some desired levels of quantum security. These parameters are based on the hardness of recovering a hidden isogeny between two elliptic curves, using a quantum subexponential algorithm of Childs, Jao and Soukharev. This algorithm combines two building blocks: first, a quantum algorithm for recovering a hidden shift in a commutative group. Second, a computation in superposition of all isogenies originating from a given curve, which the algorithm calls as a black box.</p>
<p>In this paper, we give a comprehensive security analysis of CSIDH. Our first step is to revisit three quantum algorithms for the abelian hidden shift problem from the perspective of non-asymptotic cost, with trade-offs between their quantum and classical complexities. Second, we complete the non-asymptotic study of the black box in the hidden shift algorithm. We give a quantum procedure that evaluates CSIDH-512 using less than 40 000 logical qubits.</p>
<p>This allows us to show that the parameters proposed by the authors of CSIDH do not meet their expected quantum security.</p>

<p>In this paper, we introduce a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a connecting (\mathcal {O})-ideal between two supersingular elliptic curves over (\mathbb {F}_p) with common (\mathbb {F}_p)-endomorphism ring (\mathcal {O}), given a description of their full endomorphism rings. This algorithm provides a reduction of the security of the CSIDH cryptosystem to the problem of computing endomorphism rings of supersingular elliptic curves. A similar reduction for SIDH appeared at Asiacrypt 2016, but relies on totally different techniques. Furthermore, we also show that any supersingular elliptic curve constructed using the complex-multiplication method can be located precisely in the supersingular isogeny graph by explicitly deriving a path to a known base curve. This result prohibits the use of such curves as a building block for a hash function into the supersingular isogeny graph.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hardness of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem is by now a cornerstone of the cryptographic landscape. In many of its applications the so called ‚ÄúLWE secret‚Äù is not sampled uniformly, but comes from a distribution with some min-entropy. This variant, known as ‚ÄúEntropic LWE‚Äù, has been studied in a number of works, starting with Goldwasser et al. (ICS 2010). However, so far it was only known how to prove the hardness of Entropic LWE for secret distributions supported inside a ball of small radius.</p>
<p>In this work we resolve the hardness of Entropic LWE with arbitrary long secrets, in the following sense. We show an entropy bound that guarantees the security of arbitrary Entropic LWE. This bound is higher than what is required in the ball-bounded setting, but we show that this is essentially tight. Tightness is shown unconditionally for highly-composite moduli, and using black-box impossibility for arbitrary moduli.</p>
<p>Technically, we show that the entropic hardness of LWE relies on a simple to describe lossiness property of the distribution of secrets itself. This is simply the probability of recovering a random sample from this distribution s, given (s+e), where e is Gaussian noise (i.e. the quality of the distribution of secrets as an error correcting code for Gaussian noise). We hope that this characterization will make it easier to derive entropic LWE results more easily in the future. We also use our techniques to show new results for the ball-bounded setting, essentially showing that under a strong enough assumption even polylogarithmic entropy suffices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pseudorandom functions (PRFs) are fundamental objects in cryptography that play a central role in symmetric-key cryptography. Although PRFs can be constructed from one-way functions generically, these black-box constructions are usually inefficient and require deep circuits to evaluate compared to direct PRF constructions that rely on specific algebraic assumptions. From lattices, one can directly construct PRFs from the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption (or its ring variant) using the result of Banerjee, Peikert, and Rosen (Eurocrypt 2012) and its subsequent works. However, all existing PRFs in this line of work rely on the hardness of the LWE problem where the associated modulus is super-polynomial in the security parameter.</p>
<p>In this work, we provide two new PRF constructions from the LWE problem. In each of these constructions, each focuses on either minimizing the depth of its evaluation circuit or providing key-homomorphism while relying on the hardness of the LWE problem with either a polynomial modulus or nearly polynomial modulus. Along the way, we introduce a new variant of the LWE problem called the Learning with Rounding and Errors (LWRE) problem. We show that for certain settings of parameters, the LWRE problem is as hard as the LWE problem. We then show that the hardness of the LWRE problem naturally induces a pseudorandom synthesizer that can be used to construct a low-depth PRF. The techniques that we introduce to study the LWRE problem can then be used to derive variants of existing key-homomorphic PRFs whose security can be reduced from the hardness of the LWE problem with a much smaller modulus.</p>

<p>Many advanced lattice based cryptosystems require to sample lattice points from Gaussian distributions. One challenge for this task is that all current algorithms resort to floating-point arithmetic (FPA) at some point, which has numerous drawbacks in practice: it requires numerical stability analysis, extra storage for high-precision, lazy/backtracking techniques for efficiency, and may suffer from weak determinism which can completely break certain schemes.</p>
<p>In this paper, we give techniques to implement Gaussian sampling over general lattices without using FPA. To this end, we revisit the approach of Peikert, using perturbation sampling. Peikert‚Äôs approach uses continuous Gaussian sampling and some decomposition (\mathbf {\Sigma }= \mathbf {A}\mathbf {A}^t) of the target covariance matrix (\mathbf {\Sigma }). The suggested decomposition, e.g. the Cholesky decomposition, gives rise to a square matrix (\mathbf {A}) with real (not integer) entries. Our idea, in a nutshell, is to replace this decomposition by an integral one. While there is in general no integer solution if we restrict (\mathbf {A}) to being a square matrix, we show that such a decomposition can be efficiently found by allowing (\mathbf {A}) to be wider (say (n \times 9n)). This can be viewed as an extension of Lagrange‚Äôs four-square theorem to matrices. In addition, we adapt our integral decomposition algorithm to the ring setting: for power-of-2 cyclotomics, we can exploit the tower of rings structure for improved complexity and compactness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this paper, we propose Tweak-aNd-Tweak ((\mathsf {TNT}) for short) mode, which builds a tweakable block cipher from three independent block ciphers. (\mathsf {TNT}) handles the tweak input by simply XOR-ing the unmodified tweak into the internal state of block ciphers twice. Due to its simplicity, (\mathsf {TNT}) can also be viewed as a way of turning a block cipher into a tweakable block cipher by dividing the block cipher into three chunks, and adding the tweak at the two cutting points only. (\mathsf {TNT}) is proven to be of beyond-birthday-bound (2^{2n/3}) security, under the assumption that the three chunks are independent secure n-bit SPRPs. It clearly brings minimum possible overhead to both software and hardware implementations. To demonstrate this, an instantiation named TNT-AES with (6 ), (6 ), (6 ) rounds of AES as the underlying block ciphers is proposed. Besides the inherent proven security bound and tweak-independent rekeying feature of the (\mathsf {TNT}) mode, the performance of TNT-AES is comparable with all existing TBCs designed through modular methods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keyed and unkeyed cryptographic permutations often iterate simple round functions. Substitution-permutation networks (SPNs) are an approach that is popular since the mid 1990s. One of the new directions in the design of these round functions is to reduce the substitution (S-Box) layer from a full one to a partial one, uniformly distributed over all the rounds. LowMC and Zorro are examples of this approach.</p>
<p>A relevant freedom in the design space is to allow for a highly non-uniform distribution of S-Boxes. However, choosing rounds that are so different from each other is very rarely done, as it makes security analysis and implementation much harder.</p>
<p>We develop the design strategy Hades and an analysis framework for it, which despite this increased complexity allows for security arguments against many classes of attacks, similar to earlier simpler SPNs. The framework builds upon the wide trail design strategy, and it additionally allows for security arguments against algebraic attacks, which are much more of a concern when algebraically simple S-Boxes are used.</p>
<p>Subsequently, this is put into practice by concrete instances and benchmarks for a use case that generally benefits from a smaller number of S-Boxes and showcases the diversity of design options we support: A candidate cipher natively working with objects in (\text {GF}(p)), for securing data transfers with distributed databases using secure multiparty computation (MPC). Compared to the currently fastest design MiMC, we observe significant improvements in online bandwidth requirements and throughput with a simultaneous reduction of preprocessing effort, while having a comparable online latency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper proposes tweakable block cipher (TBC) based modes (\mathsf {PFB_Plus}) and (\mathsf {PFB}\omega ) that are efficient in threshold implementations (TI). Let t be an algebraic degree of a target function, e.g. (t=1) (resp. (t&gt;1)) for linear (resp. non-linear) function. The d-th order TI encodes the internal state into (d t + 1) shares. Hence, the area size increases proportionally to the number of shares. This implies that TBC based modes can be smaller than block cipher (BC) based modes in TI because TBC requires s-bit block to ensure s-bit security, e.g. PFB and Romulus, while BC requires 2s-bit block. However, even with those TBC based modes, the minimum we can reach is 3 shares of s-bit state with (t=2) and the first-order TI ((d=1)).</p>
<p>Our first design (\mathsf {PFB_Plus}) aims to break the barrier of the 3s-bit state in TI. The block size of an underlying TBC is s/2 bits and the output of TBC is linearly expanded to s bits. This expanded state requires only 2 shares in the first-order TI, which makes the total state size 2.5s bits. We also provide rigorous security proof of (\mathsf {PFB_Plus}). Our second design (\mathsf {PFB}\omega ) further increases a parameter (\omega ): a ratio of the security level s to the block size of an underlying TBC. We prove security of (\mathsf {PFB}\omega ) for any (\omega ) under some assumptions for an underlying TBC and for parameters used to update a state. Next, we show a concrete instantiation of (\mathsf {PFB_Plus}) for 128-bit security. It requires a TBC with 64-bit block, 128-bit key and 128-bit tweak, while no existing TBC can support it. We design a new TBC by extending SKINNY and provide basic security evaluation. Finally, we give hardware benchmarks of (\mathsf {PFB_Plus}) in the first-order TI to show that TI of (\mathsf {PFB_Plus}) is smaller than that of PFB by more than one thousand gates and is the smallest within the schemes having 128-bit security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We present a 2-party private set intersection (PSI) protocol which provides security against malicious participants, yet is almost as fast as the fastest known semi-honest PSI protocol of Kolesnikov et al. (CCS 2016).</p>
<p>Our protocol is based on a new approach for two-party PSI, which can be instantiated to provide security against either malicious or semi-honest adversaries. The protocol is unique in that the only difference between the semi-honest and malicious versions is an instantiation with different parameters for a linear error-correction code. It is also the first PSI protocol which is concretely efficient while having linear communication and security against malicious adversaries, while running in the OT-hybrid model (assuming a non-programmable random oracle).</p>
<p>State of the art semi-honest PSI protocols take advantage of cuckoo hashing, but it has proven a challenge to use cuckoo hashing for malicious security. Our protocol is the first to use cuckoo hashing for malicious-secure PSI. We do so via a new data structure, called a probe-and-XOR of strings ((\mathsf{PaXoS})), which may be of independent interest. This abstraction captures important properties of previous data structures, most notably garbled Bloom filters. While an encoding by a garbled Bloom filter is larger by a factor of (\varOmega (\lambda )) than the original data, we describe a significantly improved (\mathsf{PaXoS}) based on cuckoo hashing that achieves constant rate while being no worse in other relevant efficiency measures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We show a new general approach for constructing maliciously-secure two-round oblivious transfer (OT). Specifically, we provide a generic sequence of transformations to upgrade a very basic notion of two-round OT, which we call elementary OT, to UC-secure OT. We then give simple constructions of elementary OT under the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption or the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) assumption, yielding the first constructions of malicious (UC-secure) two-round OT under these assumptions. Since two-round OT is complete for two-round 2-party and multi-party computation in the malicious setting, we also achieve the first constructions of the latter under these assumptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider the setup where n parties are each given an element (x_i) in the finite field (\mathbb {F}_q) and the goal is to compute the sum (\sum _i x_i) in a secure fashion and with as little communication as possible. We study this problem in the anonymized model of Ishai et al. (FOCS 2006) where each party may broadcast anonymous messages on an insecure channel.</p>
<p>We present a new analysis of the one-round ‚Äúsplit and mix‚Äù protocol of Ishai et al. In order to achieve the same security parameter, our analysis reduces the required number of messages by a (\varTheta (\log n)) multiplicative factor.</p>
<p>We also prove lower bounds showing that the dependence of the number of messages on the domain size, the number of parties, and the security parameter is essentially tight.</p>
<p>Using a reduction of Balle et al. (2019), our improved analysis of the protocol of Ishai et al. yields, in the same model, an (\left( \varepsilon , \delta \right) )-differentially private protocol for aggregation that, for any constant (\varepsilon &gt; 0) and any (\delta = \frac{1}{\text {poly}(n)}), incurs only a constant error and requires only a constant number of messages per party. Previously, such a protocol was known only for (\varOmega (\log n)) messages per party.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An intensive effort by the cryptographic community to minimize the round complexity of secure multi-party computation (MPC) has recently led to optimal two-round protocols from minimal assumptions. Most of the proposed solutions, however, make use of a broadcast channel in every round, and it is unclear if the broadcast channel can be replaced by standard point-to-point communication in a round-preserving manner, and if so, at what cost on the resulting security.</p>
<p>In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the trade-off between number of broadcast rounds and achievable security level for two-round MPC tolerating arbitrarily many active corruptions. Specifically, we consider all possible combinations of broadcast and point-to-point rounds against the three standard levels of security for maliciously secure MPC protocols, namely, security with identifiable, unanimous, and selective abort. For each of these notions and each combination of broadcast and point-to-point rounds, we provide either a tight feasibility or an infeasibility result of two-round MPC. Our feasibility results hold assuming two-round OT in the CRS model, whereas our impossibility results hold given any correlated randomness.</p>
