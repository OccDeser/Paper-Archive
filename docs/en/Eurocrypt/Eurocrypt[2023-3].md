### Abstract
> Differential obliviousness (DO) is a privacy notion which guarantees that the access patterns of a program satisfies differential privacy. Differential obliviousness was studied in a sequence of recent works as a relaxation of full obliviousness. Earlier works showed that DO not only allows us to circumvent the logarithmic-overhead barrier of fully oblivious algorithms, in many cases, it also allows us to achieve polynomial speedup over full obliviousness, since it avoids “padding to the worst-case” behavior of fully oblivious algorithms.

### Abstract
> Deniable Authentication is a highly desirable property for secure messaging protocols: it allows a sender Alice to authentically transmit messages to a designated receiver Bob in such a way that only Bob gets convinced that Alice indeed sent these messages. In particular, it guarantees that even if Bob tries to convince a (non-designated) party Judy that Alice sent some message, and even if Bob gives Judy his own secret key, Judy will not be convinced: as far as Judy knows, Bob could be making it all up!

### Abstract
> We show that the adaptive compromise security definitions of Jaeger and Tyagi (Crypto ’20) cannot be applied in several natural use-cases. These include proving multi-user security from single-user security, the security of the cascade PRF, and the security of schemes sharing the same ideal primitive. We provide new variants of the definitions and show that they resolve these issues with composition. Extending these definitions to the asymmetric settings, we establish the security of the modular KEM/DEM and Fujisaki-Okamoto approaches to public key encryption in the full adaptive compromise setting. This allows instantiations which are more efficient and standard than prior constructions.

### Abstract
> In this paper, we consider tight multi-user security under adaptive corruptions, where the adversary can adaptively corrupt some users and obtain their secret keys. We propose generic constructions for a bunch of primitives, and the instantiations from the matrix decisional Diffie-Hellman (MDDH) assumptions yield the following schemes:

### Abstract
> A private puncturable pseudorandom function (PRF) enables one to create a constrained version of a PRF key, which can be used to evaluate the PRF at all but some punctured points. In addition, the constrained key reveals no information about the punctured points and the PRF values on them. Existing constructions of private puncturable PRFs are only proven to be secure against a restricted adversary that must commit to the punctured points before viewing any information. It is an open problem to achieve the more natural adaptive security, where the adversary can make all its choices on-the-fly.

### Abstract
> We propose and analyze a simple strategy for constructing 1-key constrained pseudorandom functions (CPRFs) from homomorphic secret sharing. In the process, we obtain the following contributions: first, we identify desirable properties for the underlying HSS scheme for our strategy to work. Second, we show that (most of) recent existing HSS schemes satisfy these properties, leading to instantiations of CPRFs for various constraints and from various assumptions. Notably, we obtain the first (1-key selectively secure, private) CPRFs for inner-product and (1-key selectively secure) CPRFs for \(\textsf{NC}^1\) from the DCR assumption, and more. Last, we revisit two applications of HSS equipped with these additional properties to secure computation: we obtain secure computation in the silent preprocessing model with one party being able to precompute its whole preprocessing material before even knowing the other party, and we construct one-sided statistically secure computation with sublinear communication for restricted forms of computation.

### Abstract
> There are two competing approaches to bootstrap the FHEW fully homomorphic encryption scheme (Ducas and Micciancio, Eurocrypt 2015) and its variants: the original AP/FHEW method, which supports arbitrary secret key distributions, and the improved GINX/TFHE method, which uses much smaller evaluation keys, but is directly applicable only to binary secret keys, restricting the scheme’s applicability.

### Abstract
> In this paper, we perform a systematic study of functions \(f: \mathbb {Z}_{p^e} \rightarrow \mathbb {Z}_{p^e}\) and categorize those functions that can be represented by a polynomial with integer coefficients. More specifically, we cover the following properties: necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an integer polynomial representation; computation of such a representation; and the complete set of equivalent polynomials that represent a given function.

### Abstract
> This work continues the exploration of the batch framework proposed in Batch Bootstrapping I (Liu and Wang, Eurocrypt 2023). By further designing novel batch homomorphic algorithms based on the batch framework, this work shows how to bootstrap \(\lambda \) LWE input ciphertexts within a polynomial modulus, using \(\tilde{O}(\lambda )\) FHE multiplications. This implies an amortized complexity \(\tilde{O}(1)\) FHE multiplications per input ciphertext, significantly improving our first work (whose amortized complexity is \(\tilde{O}(\lambda ^{0.75})\)) and the theoretical state of the art MS18 (Micciancio and Sorrell, ICALP 2018), whose amortized complexity is \(O(3^{1/\epsilon } \cdot \lambda ^{\epsilon })\), for any arbitrary constant \(\epsilon \).

### Abstract
> Vector commitment schemes allow a user to commit to a vector of values \(\textbf{x}\in \{0,1\}^\ell \) and later, open up the commitment to a specific set of positions. Both the size of the commitment and the size of the opening should be succinct (i.e., polylogarithmic in the length \(\ell \) of the vector). Vector commitments and their generalizations to polynomial commitments and functional commitments are key building blocks for many cryptographic protocols.

### Abstract
> Laconic cryptography is an emerging paradigm that enables cryptographic primitives with sublinear communication complexity in just two messages. In particular, a two-message protocol between Alice and Bob is called laconic if its communication and computation complexity are essentially independent of the size of Alice’s input. This can be thought of as a dual notion of fully-homomorphic encryption, as it enables “Bob-optimized” protocols. This paradigm has led to tremendous progress in recent years. However, all existing constructions of laconic primitives are considered only of theoretical interest: They all rely on non-black-box cryptographic techniques, which are highly impractical.

### Abstract
> Decentralized multi-authority attribute-based encryption (\(\textsf{MA}\text {-}\textsf{ABE}\)) is a distributed generalization of standard (ciphertext-policy) attribute-based encryption where there is no trusted central authority: any party can become an authority and issue private keys, and there is no requirement for any global coordination other than the creation of an initial set of common reference parameters.

### Abstract
> We investigate the best-possible (asymptotic) efficiency of functional encryption (FE) and attribute-based encryption (ABE) by proving inherent space-time trade-offs and constructing nearly optimal schemes. We consider the general notion of partially hiding functional encryption (PHFE), capturing both FE and ABE, and the most efficient computation model of random-access machine (RAM). In PHFE, a secret key \(\textsf{sk}_f\) is associated with a function f, whereas a ciphertext \(\textsf{ct}_x(y)\) is tied to a public input x and encrypts a private input y. Decryption reveals f(x, y) and nothing else about y.

### Abstract
> Attribute-based encryption (ABE) generalizes public-key encryption and enables fine-grained control to encrypted data. However, ABE upends the traditional trust model of public-key encryption by requiring a single trusted authority to issue decryption keys. If an adversary compromises the central authority and exfiltrates its secret key, then the adversary can decrypt every ciphertext in the system.

### Abstract
> We propose the first unbounded functional encryption (FE) scheme for quadratic functions and its extension, in which the sizes of messages to be encrypted are not a priori bounded. Prior to our work, all FE schemes for quadratic functions are bounded, meaning that the message length is fixed at the setup. In the first scheme, encryption takes \(\{x_{i}\}_{i \in S_{c}}\), key generation takes \(\{c_{i,j}\}_{i,j \in S_{k}}\), and decryption outputs \(\sum _{i,j \in S_{k}} c_{i,j}x_{i}x_{j}\) if and only if \(S_{k} \subseteq S_{c}\), where the sizes of \(S_{c}\) and \(S_{k}\) can be arbitrary. Our second scheme is the extension of the first scheme to partially-hiding FE that computes an arithmetic branching program on a public input and a quadratic function on a private input. Concretely, encryption takes a public input \(\textbf{u}\) in addition to \(\{x_{i}\}_{i \in S_{c}}\), a secret key is associated with arithmetic branching programs \(\{f_{i,j}\}_{i,j \in S_{k}}\), and decryption yields \(\sum _{i,j \in S_{k}} f_{i,j}(\textbf{u})x_{i}x_{j}\) if and only if \(S_{k} \subseteq S_{c}\). Both our schemes are based on pairings and secure in the simulation-based model under the standard MDDH assumption.

### Abstract
> A broadcast, trace and revoke system generalizes broadcast encryption as well as traitor tracing. In such a scheme, an encryptor can specify a list \(L \subseteq N\) of revoked users so that (i) users in L can no longer decrypt ciphertexts, (ii) ciphertext size is independent of L, (iii) a pirate decryption box supports tracing of compromised users. The “holy grail” of this line of work is a construction which resists unbounded collusions, achieves all parameters (including public and secret key) sizes independent of |L| and |N|, and is based on polynomial hardness assumptions. In this work we make the following contributions:
