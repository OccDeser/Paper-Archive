<blockquote>
<p>Mathematics and cryptography have a long history together, with the ups and downs inherent in any long relationship. Whether it is a marriage of convenience or a love match, their progeny have lives of their own and have had an impact on the world. This invited lecture will briefly recall some high points from the past, give speculation and encouragement for the future of this marriage, and give counseling on how to improve communication, resolve conflicts, and play well together, based on personal experience and lessons learned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boneh, Waters and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2014) used multilinear maps to provide a solution to the long-standing problem of public-key broadcast encryption (BE) where all parameters in the system are small. In this work, we improve their result by providing a solution that uses only bilinear maps and Learning With Errors (LWE). Our scheme is fully collusion-resistant against any number of colluders, and can be generalized to an identity-based broadcast system with short parameters. Thus, we reclaim the problem of optimal broadcast encryption from the land of ‚ÄúObfustopia‚Äù.</p>
<p>Our main technical contribution is a ciphertext policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme which achieves special efficiency properties ‚Äì its ciphertext size, secret key size, and public key size are all independent of the size of the circuits supported by the scheme. We show that this special CP-ABE scheme implies BE with optimal parameters; but it may also be of independent interest. Our constructions rely on a novel interplay of bilinear maps and LWE, and are proven secure in the generic group model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We present the first protocols for private information retrieval that allow fast (sublinear-time) database lookups without increasing the server-side storage requirements. To achieve these efficiency goals, our protocols work in an offline/online model. In an offline phase, which takes place before the client has decided which database bit it wants to read, the client fetches a short string from the servers. In a subsequent online phase, the client can privately retrieve its desired bit of the database by making a second query to the servers. By pushing the bulk of the server-side computation into the offline phase (which is independent of the client‚Äôs query), our protocols allow the online phase to complete very quickly‚Äîin time sublinear in the size of the database. Our protocols can provide statistical security in the two-server setting and computational security in the single-server setting. Finally, we prove that, in this model, our protocols are optimal in terms of the trade-off they achieve between communication and running time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We propose a new approach to construct general-purpose indistinguishability obfuscation (iO). Our construction is obtained via a new intermediate primitive that we call split fully-homomorphic encryption (split FHE), which we show to be sufficient for constructing iO. Specifically, split FHE is FHE where decryption takes the following two-step syntactic form: (i) A secret decryption step uses the secret key and produces a hint which is (asymptotically) shorter than the length of the encrypted message, and (ii) a public decryption step that only requires the ciphertext and the previously generated hint (and not the entire secret key), and recovers the encrypted message. In terms of security, the hints for a set of ciphertexts should not allow one to violate semantic security for any other ciphertexts.</p>
<p>Next, we show a generic candidate construction of split FHE based on three building blocks: (i) A standard FHE scheme with linear decrypt-and-multiply (which can be instantiated with essentially all LWE-based constructions), (ii) a linearly homomorphic encryption scheme with short decryption hints (such as the Damg√•rd-Jurik encryption scheme, based on the DCR problem), and (iii) a cryptographic hash function (which can be based on a variety of standard assumptions). Our approach is heuristic in the sense that our construction is not provably secure and makes implicit assumptions about the interplay between these underlying primitives. We show evidence that this construction is secure by providing an argument in an appropriately defined oracle model.</p>
<p>We view our construction as a big departure from the state-of-the-art constructions, and it is in fact quite simple.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Candidates of Indistinguishability Obfuscation ((\mathsf {iO})) can be categorized as ‚Äúdirect‚Äù or ‚Äúbootstrapping based‚Äù. Direct constructions rely on high degree multilinear maps [28, 29] and provide heuristic guarantees, while bootstrapping based constructions [2, 7, 33, 36, 38, 39] rely, in the best case, on bilinear maps as well as new variants of the Learning With Errors ((\mathsf {LWE})) assumption and pseudorandom generators. Recent times have seen exciting progress in the construction of indistinguishability obfuscation ((\mathsf {iO})) from bilinear maps (along with other assumptions) [2, 7, 33, 38].</p>
<p>As a notable exception, a recent work by Agrawal [2] provided a construction for (\mathsf {iO}) without using any maps. This work identified a new primitive, called Noisy Linear Functional Encryption ((\mathsf {NLinFE})) that provably suffices for (\mathsf {iO}) and gave a direct construction of (\mathsf {NLinFE}) from new assumptions on lattices. While a preliminary cryptanalysis for the new assumptions was provided in the original work, the author admitted the necessity of performing significantly more cryptanalysis before faith could be placed in the security of the scheme. Moreover, the author did not suggest concrete parameters for the construction.</p>
<p>In this work, we fill this gap by undertaking the task of thorough cryptanalytic study of (\mathsf {NLinFE}). We design two attacks that let the adversary completely break the security of the scheme. Our attacks are completely new and unrelated to attacks that were hitherto used to break other candidates of (\mathsf {iO}). To achieve this, we develop new cryptanalytic techniques which (we hope) will inform future designs of the primitive of (\mathsf {NLinFE}).</p>
<p>From the knowledge gained by our cryptanalytic study, we suggest modifications to the scheme. We provide a new scheme which overcomes the vulnerabilities identified before. We also provide a thorough analysis of all the security aspects of this scheme and argue why plausible attacks do not work. We additionally provide concrete parameters with which the scheme may be instantiated. We believe the security of (\mathsf {NLinFE}) stands on significantly firmer footing as a result of this work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Functional encryption (FE) combiners allow one to combine many candidates for a functional encryption scheme, possibly based on different computational assumptions, into another functional encryption candidate with the guarantee that the resulting candidate is secure as long as at least one of the original candidates is secure. The fundamental question in this area is whether FE combiners exist. There have been a series of works Ananth et al. (CRYPTO ‚Äô16), Ananth-Jain-Sahai (EUROCRYPT ‚Äô17), Ananth et al. (TCC ‚Äô19) on constructing FE combiners from various assumptions.</p>
<p>We give the first unconditional construction of combiners for functional encryption, resolving this question completely. Our construction immediately implies an unconditional universal functional encryption scheme, an FE scheme that is secure if such an FE scheme exists. Previously such results either relied on algebraic assumptions or required subexponential security assumptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Functional Encryption denotes a form of encryption where a master secret key-holder can control which functions a user can evaluate on encrypted data. Learning With Errors (LWE) (Regev, STOC‚Äô05) is known to be a useful cryptographic hardness assumption which implies strong primitives such as, for example, fully homomorphic encryption (Brakerski-Vaikuntanathan, FOCS‚Äô11) and lockable obfuscation (Goyal et al., Wichs et al., FOCS‚Äô17). Despite its stre ngth, however, there is just a limited number of functional encryption schemes which can be based on LWE. In fact, there are functional encryption schemes which can be achieved by using pairings but for which no secure instantiations from lattice-based assumptions are known: function-hiding inner product encryption (Lin, Baltico et al., CRYPTO‚Äô17) and compact quadratic functional encryption (Abdalla et al., CRYPTO‚Äô18). This raises the question whether there are some mathematical barriers which hinder us from realizing function-hiding and compact functional encryption schemes from lattice-based assumptions as LWE.</p>
<p>To study this problem, we prove an impossibility result for function-hiding functional encryption schemes which meet some algebraic restrictions at ciphertext encryption and decryption. Those restrictions are met by a lot of attribute-based, identity-based and functional encryption schemes whose security stems from LWE. Therefore, we see our results as important indications why it is hard to construct new functional encryption schemes from LWE and which mathematical restrictions have to be overcome to construct secure lattice-based functional encryption schemes for new functionalities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an early version of CRYPTO‚Äô17, Mennink and Neves proposed EWCDMD, a dual of EWCDM, and showed n-bit security, where n is the block size of the underlying block cipher. In CRYPTO‚Äô19, Chen et al. proposed permutation based design SoKAC21 and showed 2n/3-bit security, where n is the input size of the underlying permutation. In this paper we show birthday bound attacks on EWCDMD and SoKAC21, invalidating their security claims. Both attacks exploit an inherent composition nature present in the constructions. Motivated by the above two attacks exploiting the composition nature, we consider some generic relevant composition based constructions of ideal primitives (possibly in the ideal permutation and random oracle model) and present birthday bound distinguishers for them. In particular, we demonstrate a birthday bound distinguisher against (1) a secret random permutation followed by a public random function and (2) composition of two secret random functions. Our distinguishers for SoKAC21 and EWCDMD are direct consequences of (1) and (2) respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Linear cryptanalysis is one of the most important tools in use for the security evaluation of symmetric primitives. Many improvements and refinements have been published since its introduction, and many applications on different ciphers have been found. Among these upgrades, Collard et al. proposed in 2007 an acceleration of the key-recovery part of Algorithm 2 for last-round attacks based on the FFT.</p>
<p>In this paper we present a generalized, matrix-based version of the previous algorithm which easily allows us to take into consideration an arbitrary number of key-recovery rounds. We also provide efficient variants that exploit the key-schedule relations and that can be combined with multiple linear attacks.</p>
<p>Using our algorithms we provide some new cryptanalysis on PRESENT, including, to the best of our knowledge, the first attack on 28 rounds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The slide attack is a powerful cryptanalytic tool which can break iterated block ciphers with a complexity that does not depend on their number of rounds. However, it requires complete self similarity in the sense that all the rounds must be identical. While this can be the case in Feistel structures, this rarely happens in SP networks since the last round must end with an additional post-whitening subkey. In addition, in many SP networks the final round has additional asymmetries ‚Äì for example, in AES the last round omits the MixColumns operation. Such asymmetry in the last round can make it difficult to utilize most of the advanced tools which were developed for slide attacks, such as deriving from one slid pair additional slid pairs by repeatedly re-encrypting their ciphertexts. Consequently, almost all the successful applications of slide attacks against real cryptosystems (e.g., FF3, GOST, SHACAL-1) had targeted Feistel structures rather than SP networks.</p>
<p>In this paper we overcome this ‚Äúlast round problem‚Äù by developing four new types of slide attacks. We demonstrate their power by applying them to many types of AES-like structures (with and without linear mixing in the last round, with known or secret S-boxes, with periodicity of 1, 2 and 3 in their subkeys, etc). In most of these cases, the time complexity of our attack is close to (2^{n/2}), the smallest possible complexity for most slide attacks. Our new slide attacks have several unique properties: The first uses slid sets in which each plaintext from the first set forms a slid pair with some plaintext from the second set, but without knowing the exact correspondence. The second makes it possible to create from several slid pairs an exponential number of new slid pairs which form a hypercube spanned by the given pairs. The third has the unusual property that it is always successful, and the fourth can use known messages instead of chosen messages, with only slightly higher time complexity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boomerang attacks are extensions of differential attacks, that make it possible to combine two unrelated differential properties of the first and second part of a cryptosystem with probabilities p and q into a new differential-like property of the whole cryptosystem with probability (p^2q^2) (since each one of the properties has to be satisfied twice). In this paper we describe a new version of boomerang attacks which uses the counterintuitive idea of throwing out most of the data in order to force equalities between certain values on the ciphertext side. In certain cases, this creates a correlation between the four probabilistic events, which increases the probability of the combined property to (p^2q) and increases the signal to noise ratio of the resultant distinguisher. We call this variant a retracing boomerang attack since we make sure that the boomerang we throw follows the same path on its forward and backward directions. To demonstrate the power of the new technique, we apply it to the case of 5-round AES. This version of AES was repeatedly attacked by a large variety of techniques, but for twenty years its complexity had remained stuck at (2^{32}). At Crypto‚Äô18 it was finally reduced to (2^{24}) (for full key recovery), and with our new technique we can further reduce the complexity of full key recovery to the surprisingly low value of (2^{16.5}) (i.e., only 90, 000 encryption/decryption operations are required for a full key recovery on half the rounds of AES).</p>
<p>In addition to improving previous attacks, our new technique unveils a hidden relationship between boomerang attacks and two other cryptanalytic techniques, the yoyo game and the recently introduced mixture differentials.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We revisit the well-studied problem of extracting nearly uniform randomness from an arbitrary source of sufficient min-entropy. Strong seeded extractors solve this problem by relying on a public random seed, which is unknown to the source. Here, we consider a setting where the seed is reused over time and the source may depend on prior calls to the extractor with the same seed. Can we still extract nearly uniform randomness?</p>
<p>In more detail, we assume the seed is chosen randomly, but the source can make arbitrary oracle queries to the extractor with the given seed before outputting a sample. We require that the sample has entropy and differs from any of the previously queried values. The extracted output should look uniform even to a distinguisher that gets the seed. We consider two variants of the problem, depending on whether the source only outputs the sample, or whether it can also output some correlated public auxiliary information that preserves the sample‚Äôs entropy. Our results are:</p>
<p>Without Auxiliary Information: We show that every pseudo-random function (PRF) with a sufficiently high security level is a good extractor in this setting, even if the distinguisher is computationally unbounded. We further show that the source necessarily needs to be computationally bounded and that such extractors imply one-way functions.</p>
<p>With Auxiliary Information: We construct secure extractors in this setting, as long as both the source and the distinguisher are computationally bounded. We give several constructions based on different intermediate primitives, yielding instantiations based on the DDH, DLIN, LWE or DCR assumptions. On the negative side, we show that one cannot prove security against computationally unbounded distinguishers in this setting under any standard assumption via a black-box reduction. Furthermore, even when restricting to computationally bounded distinguishers, we show that there exist PRFs that are insecure as extractors in this setting and that a large class of constructions cannot be proven secure via a black-box reduction from standard assumptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For more than 30 years, cryptographers have been looking for public sources of uniform randomness in order to use them as a set-up to run appealing cryptographic protocols without relying on trusted third parties. Unfortunately, nowadays it is fair to assess that assuming the existence of physical phenomena producing public uniform randomness is far from reality.</p>
<p>It is known that uniform randomness cannot be extracted from a single weak source. A well-studied way to overcome this is to consider several independent weak sources. However, this means we must trust the various sampling processes of weak randomness from physical processes.</p>
<p>Motivated by the above state of affairs, this work considers a set-up where players can access multiple potential sources of weak randomness, several of which may be jointly corrupted by a computationally unbounded adversary. We introduce SHELA (Somewhere Honest Entropic Look Ahead) sources to model this situation.</p>
<p>We show that there is no hope of extracting uniform randomness from a SHELA source. Instead, we focus on the task of Somewhere-Extraction (i.e., outputting several candidate strings, some of which are uniformly distributed ‚Äì yet we do not know which). We give explicit constructions of Somewhere-Extractors for SHELA sources with good parameters.</p>
<p>Then, we present applications of the above somewhere-extractor where the public uniform randomness can be replaced by the output of such extraction from corruptible sources, greatly outperforming trivial solutions. The output of somewhere-extraction is also useful in other settings, such as a suitable source of random coins for many randomized algorithms.</p>
<p>In another front, we comprehensively study the problem of Somewhere-Extraction from a weak source, resulting in a series of bounds. Our bounds highlight the fact that, in most regimes of parameters (including those relevant for applications), SHELA sources significantly outperform weak sources of comparable parameters both when it comes to the process of Somewhere-Extraction, and in the task of amplification of success probability in randomized algorithms. Moreover, the low quality of somewhere-extraction from weak sources excludes its use in various efficient applications.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been exciting progress on building two-source extractors for sources with low min-entropy. Unfortunately, all known explicit constructions of two-source extractors in the low entropy regime suffer from non-negligible error, and building such extractors with negligible error remains an open problem. We investigate this problem in the computational setting, and obtain the following results.</p>
<p>We construct an explicit 2-source extractor, and even an explicit non-malleable extractor, with negligible error, for sources with low min-entropy, under computational assumptions in the Common Random String (CRS) model. More specifically, we assume that a CRS is generated once and for all, and allow the min-entropy sources to depend on the CRS. We obtain our constructions by using the following transformations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Building on the technique of [5], we show a general transformation for converting any computational 2-source extractor (in the CRS model) into a computational non-malleable extractor (in the CRS model), for sources with similar min-entropy.</li>
</ol>
<p>We emphasize that the resulting computational non-malleable extractor is resilient to arbitrarily many tampering attacks (a property that is impossible to achieve information theoretically). This may be of independent interest.</p>
<p>This transformation uses cryptography, and relies on the sub-exponential hardness of the Decisional Diffie Hellman (DDH) assumption.</p>
<ol>
<li>Next, using the blueprint of [1], we give a transformation converting our computational non-malleable extractor (in the CRS model) into a computational 2-source extractor for sources with low min-entropy (in the CRS model). Our 2-source extractor works for unbalanced sources: specifically, we require one of the sources to be larger than a specific polynomial in the other.</li>
</ol>
<p>This transformation does not incur any additional assumptions. Our analysis makes a novel use of the leakage lemma of Gentry and Wichs [18].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We consider a collision search problem (CSP), where given a parameter C, the goal is to find C collision pairs in a random function (f:[N] \rightarrow [N]) (where ([N] = {0,1,\ldots ,N-1})) using S bits of memory. Algorithms for CSP have numerous cryptanalytic applications such as space-efficient attacks on double and triple encryption. The best known algorithm for CSP is parallel collision search (PCS) published by van Oorschot and Wiener, which achieves the time-space tradeoff (T^2 \cdot S = \tilde{O}(C^2 \cdot N)).</p>
<p>In this paper, we prove that any algorithm for CSP satisfies (T^2 \cdot S = \tilde{\varOmega }(C^2 \cdot N)), hence the best known time-space tradeoff is optimal (up to poly-logarithmic factors in N). On the other hand, we give strong evidence that proving similar unconditional time-space tradeoff lower bounds on CSP applications (such as breaking double and triple encryption) may be very difficult, and would imply a breakthrough in complexity theory. Hence, we propose a new restricted model of computation and prove that under this model, the best known time-space tradeoff attack on double encryption is optimal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this work, we study the security of deterministic MAC constructions with a double-block internal state, captured by the double-block hash-then-sum ((\mathsf {DbHtS})) paradigm. Most (\mathsf {DbHtS}) constructions, including (\mathsf {PolyMAC}), (\mathsf {SUM\text {-}ECBC}), (\mathsf {PMAC\text {-}Plus}), (\mathsf {3kf9}) and (\mathsf {LightMAC\text {-}Plus}), have been proved to be pseudorandom up to (2^{\frac{2n}{3}}) queries when they are instantiated with an n-bit block cipher, while the best known generic attacks require (2^{\frac{3n}{4}}) queries.</p>
<p>We close this gap by proving the PRF-security of (\mathsf {DbHtS}) constructions up to (2^{\frac{3n}{4}}) queries (ignoring the maximum message length). The core of the security proof is to refine Mirror theory that systematically estimates the number of solutions to a system of equations and non-equations, and apply it to prove the security of the finalization function. Then we identify security requirements of the internal hash functions to ensure 3n/4-bit security of the resulting constructions when combined with the finalization function.</p>
<p>Within this framework, we prove the security of (\mathsf {DbHtS}) whose internal hash function is given as the concatenation of a universal hash function using two independent keys. This class of constructions include (\mathsf {PolyMAC}) and (\mathsf {SUM\text {-}ECBC}). Moreover, we prove the security of (\mathsf {PMAC\text {-}Plus}), (\mathsf {3kf9}) and (\mathsf {LightMAC\text {-}Plus}) up to (2^{\frac{3n}{4}}) queries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A division property is a generic tool to search for integral distinguishers, and automatic tools such as MILP or SAT/SMT allow us to evaluate the propagation efficiently. In the application to stream ciphers, it enables us to estimate the security of cube attacks theoretically, and it leads to the best key-recovery attacks against well-known stream ciphers. However, it was reported that some of the key-recovery attacks based on the division property degenerate to distinguishing attacks due to the inaccuracy of the division property. Three-subset division property (without unknown subset) is a promising method to solve this inaccuracy problem, and a new algorithm using automatic tools for the three-subset division property was recently proposed at Asiacrypt2019. In this paper, we first show that this state-of-the-art algorithm is not always efficient and we cannot improve the existing key-recovery attacks. Then, we focus on the feature of the three-subset division property without unknown subset and propose another new efficient algorithm using automatic tools. Our algorithm is more efficient than existing algorithms, and it can improve existing key-recovery attacks. In the application to Trivium, we show a 841-round key-recovery attack. We also show that a 855-round key-recovery attack, which was proposed at CRYPTO2018, has a critical flaw and does not work. As a result, our 841-round attack becomes the best key-recovery attack. In the application to Grain-128AEAD, we show that the known 184-round key-recovery attack degenerates to distinguishing attacks. Then, the distinguishing attacks are improved up to 189 rounds, and we also show the best key-recovery attack against 190 rounds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A blackbox secret sharing (BBSS) scheme works in exactly the same way for all finite Abelian groups G; it can be instantiated for any such group G and only black-box access to its group operations and to random group elements is required. A secret is a single group element and each of the n players‚Äô shares is a vector of such elements. Share-computation and secret-reconstruction is by integer linear combinations. These do not depend on G, and neither do the privacy and reconstruction parameters t, r. This classical, fundamental primitive was introduced by Desmedt and Frankel (CRYPTO 1989) in their context of ‚Äúthreshold cryptography.‚Äù The expansion factor is the total number of group elements in a full sharing divided by n. For threshold BBSS with t-privacy ((1\le t \le n-1)), (t+1)-reconstruction and arbitrary n, constructions with minimal expansion (O(\log n)) exist (CRYPTO 2002, 2005).</p>
<p>These results are firmly rooted in number theory; each makes (different) judicious choices of orders in number fields admitting a vector of elements of very large length (in the number field degree) whose corresponding Vandermonde-determinant is sufficiently controlled so as to enable BBSS by a suitable adaptation of Shamir‚Äôs scheme. Alternative approaches generally lead to very large expansion. The state of the art of BBSS has not changed for the last 17 years.</p>
<p>Our contributions are two-fold. (1) We introduce a novel, nontrivial, effective construction of BBSS based on coding theory instead of number theory. For threshold-BBSS we also achieve minimal expansion factor (O(\log n)). (2) Our method is more versatile. Namely, we show, for the first time, BBSS that is near-threshold, i.e., (r-t) is an arbitrarily small constant fraction of n, and that has expansion factor O(1), i.e., individual share-vectors of constant length (‚Äúasymptotically expansionless‚Äù). Threshold can be concentrated essentially freely across full range. We also show expansion is minimal for near-threshold and that such BBSS cannot be attained by previous methods.</p>
<p>Our general construction is based on a well-known mathematical principle, the local-global principle. More precisely, we first construct BBSS over local rings through either Reed-Solomon or algebraic geometry codes. We then ‚Äúglue‚Äù these schemes together in a dedicated manner to obtain a global secret sharing scheme, i.e., defined over the integers, which, as we finally prove using novel insights, has the desired BBSS properties. Though our main purpose here is advancing BBSS for its own sake, we also briefly address possible protocol applications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evolving secret-sharing schemes, introduced by Komargodski, Naor, and Yogev (TCC 2016b), are secret-sharing schemes in which there is no a-priory upper bound on the number of parties that will participate. The parties arrive one by one and when a party arrives the dealer gives it a share; the dealer cannot update this share when other parties arrive. Motivated by the fact that when the number of parties is known, ramp secret-sharing schemes are more efficient than threshold secret-sharing schemes, we study evolving ramp secret-sharing schemes. Specifically, we study evolving (b(j), g(j))-ramp secret-sharing schemes, where (g,b: \mathbb {N}\rightarrow \mathbb {N}) are non-decreasing functions. In such schemes, any set of parties that for some j contains g(j) parties from the first parties that arrive can reconstruct the secret, and any set such that for every j contains less than b(j) parties from the first j parties that arrive cannot learn any information about the secret.</p>
<p>We focus on the case that the gap is small, namely (g(j)-b(j)=j^{\beta }) for (0&lt;\beta &lt;1). We show that there is an evolving ramp secret-sharing scheme with gap (t^{\beta }), in which the share size of the j-th party is (\tilde{O}(j^{4-\frac{1}{\log ^2 {1/\beta }}})). Furthermore, we show that our construction results in much better share size for fixed values of (\beta ), i.e., there is an evolving ramp secret-sharing scheme with gap (\sqrt{j}), in which the share size of the j-th party is (\tilde{O}(j)). Our construction should be compared to the best known evolving g(j)-threshold secret-sharing schemes (i.e., when (b(j)=g(j)-1)) in which the share size of the j-th party is (\tilde{O}(j^4)). Thus, our construction offers a significant improvement for every constant (\beta ), showing that allowing a gap between the sizes of the authorized and unauthorized sets can reduce the share size.</p>
<p>In addition, we present an evolving (k/2, k)-ramp secret-sharing scheme for a constant k (which can be very big), where any set of parties of size at least k can reconstruct the secret and any set of parties of size at most k/2 cannot learn any information about the secret. The share size of the j-th party in our construction is (O(\log k\log j)). This is an improvement over the best known evolving k-threshold secret-sharing schemes in which the share size of the j-th party is (O(k\log j)).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Threshold secret sharing allows a dealer to split a secret into n shares such that any authorized subset of cardinality at least t of those shares efficiently reveals the secret, while at the same time any unauthorized subset of cardinality less than t contains no information about the secret. Leakage-resilience additionally requires that the secret remains hidden even if one is given a bounded amount of additional leakage from every share.</p>
<p>In this work, we study leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes and prove a lower bound on the share size and the required amount of randomness of any information-theoretically secure scheme. We prove that for any information-theoretically secure leakage-resilient secret sharing scheme either the amount of randomness across all shares or the share size has to be linear in n. More concretely, for a secret sharing scheme with p-bit long shares, (\ell )-bit leakage per share, where (\widehat{t}) shares uniquely define the remaining (n - \widehat{t}) shares, it has to hold that</p>
<p>We use this lower bound to gain further insights into a question that was recently posed by Benhamouda et al. (CRYPTO‚Äô18), who ask to what extend existing regular secret sharing schemes already provide protection against leakage. The authors proved that Shamir‚Äôs secret sharing is 1-bit leakage-resilient for reconstruction thresholds (t \ge 0.85n) and conjectured that it is also 1-bit leakage-resilient for any other threshold that is a constant fraction of the total number of shares. We do not disprove their conjecture, but show that it is the best one could possibly hope for. Concretely, we show that for large enough n and any constant (0&lt; c &lt; 1) it holds that Shamir‚Äôs secret sharing scheme is not leakage-resilient for .</p>
<p>In contrast to the setting with information-theoretic security, we show that our lower bound does not hold in the computational setting. That is, we show how to construct a leakage-resilient secret sharing scheme in the random oracle model that is secure against computationally bounded adversaries and violates the lower bound stated above.</p>

<p>In this work we present a duplex-based authenticated encryption scheme (\textsc {Friet}) based on a new permutation called (\textsc {Friet-P}). We designed (\textsc {Friet-P}) with a novel approach for cryptographic permutations and block ciphers that takes fault-attack resistance into account and that we introduce in this paper.</p>
<p>In this method, we build a permutation ({f_C}) to be embedded in a larger one, (f). First, we define (f) as a sequence of steps that all abide a chosen error-correcting code (C), i.e., that map (C)-codewords to (C)-codewords. Then, we embed ({f_C}) in (f) by first encoding its input to an element of C, applying (f) and then decoding back from C. This last step detects a fault when the output of (f) is not in (C).</p>
<p>We motivate the design of the permutation we use in (\textsc {Friet}) and report on performance in soft- and hardware. We evaluate the fault-detection capabilities of the software and simulated hardware implementations with attacks. Finally, we perform a leakage evaluation. Our code is available at https://github.com/thisimon/Friet.git.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fault attacks (FA) are one of the potent practical threats to modern cryptographic implementations. Over the years the FA techniques have evolved, gradually moving towards the exploitation of device-centric properties of the faults. In this paper, we exploit the fact that activation and propagation of a fault through a given combinational circuit (i.e., observability of a fault) is data-dependent. Next, we show that this property of combinational circuits leads to powerful Fault Template Attacks (FTA), even for implementations having dedicated protections against both power and fault-based vulnerabilities. The attacks found in this work are applicable even if the fault injection is made at the middle rounds of a block cipher, which are out of reach for most of the other existing fault analysis strategies. Quite evidently, they also work for a known-plaintext scenario. Moreover, the middle round attacks are entirely blind in the sense that no access to the ciphertexts (correct/faulty) or plaintexts are required. The adversary is only assumed to have the power of repeating an unknown plaintext several times. Practical validation over a hardware implementation of SCA-FA protected PRESENT, and simulated evaluation on a public software implementation of protected AES prove the efficacy of the proposed attacks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Deterministic generation of per-signature randomness has been a widely accepted solution to mitigate the catastrophic risk of randomness failure in Fiat‚ÄìShamir type signature schemes. However, recent studies have practically demonstrated that such de-randomized schemes, including EdDSA, are vulnerable to differential fault attacks, which enable adversaries to recover the entire secret signing key, by artificially provoking randomness reuse or corrupting computation in other ways. In order to balance concerns of both randomness failures and the threat of fault injection, some signature designs are advocating a ‚Äúhedged‚Äù derivation of the per-signature randomness, by hashing the secret key, message, and a nonce. Despite the growing popularity of the hedged paradigm in practical signature schemes, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no attempt to formally analyze the fault resilience of hedged signatures.</p>
<p>We perform a formal security analysis of the fault resilience of signature schemes constructed via the Fiat‚ÄìShamir transform. We propose a model to characterize bit-tampering fault attacks, and investigate their impact across different steps of the signing operation. We prove that, for some types of faults, attacks are mitigated by the hedged paradigm, while attacks remain possible for others. As concrete case studies, we then apply our results to XEdDSA, a hedged version of EdDSA used in the Signal messaging protocol, and to Picnic2, a hedged Fiat‚ÄìShamir signature scheme in Round 2 of the NIST Post-Quantum standardization process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We construct a new polynomial commitment scheme for univariate and multivariate polynomials over finite fields, with logarithmic size evaluation proofs and verification time, measured in the number of coefficients of the polynomial. The underlying technique is a Diophantine Argument of Knowledge (DARK), leveraging integer representations of polynomials and groups of unknown order. Security is shown from the strong RSA and the adaptive root assumptions. Moreover, the scheme does not require a trusted setup if instantiated with class groups. We apply this new cryptographic compiler to a restricted class of algebraic linear IOPs, which we call Polynomial IOPs, to obtain doubly-efficient public-coin interactive arguments of knowledge for any NP relation with succinct communication. With linear preprocessing, the online verifier‚Äôs work is logarithmic in the circuit complexity of the relation.</p>
<p>There are many existing examples of Polynomial IOPs (PIOPs) dating back to the first PCP (BFLS, STOC‚Äô91). We present a generic compilation of any PIOP using our DARK polynomial commitment scheme. In particular, compiling the PIOP from PLONK (GWC, ePrint‚Äô19), an improvement on Sonic (MBKM, CCS‚Äô19), yields a public-coin interactive argument with quasi-linear preprocessing, quasi-linear (online) prover time, logarithmic communication, and logarithmic (online) verification time in the circuit size. Applying Fiat-Shamir results in a SNARK, which we call .</p>
<p>Supersonic is also concretely efficient with 10 KB proofs and under 100 ms verification time for circuits with 1 million gates (estimated for 120-bit security). Most importantly, this SNARK is transparent: it does not require a trusted setup. We obtain zk-SNARKs by applying a hiding variant of our polynomial commitment scheme with zero-knowledge evaluations. Supersonic is the first complete zk-SNARK system that has both a practical prover time as well as asymptotically logarithmic proof size and verification time. The full version of the paper is available online [19].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We introduce the notion of a Succinct Parallelizable Argument of Knowledge (SPARK). This is an argument system with the following three properties for computing and proving a time T (non-deterministic) computation:</p>
<p>The prover‚Äôs (parallel) running time is (T + \mathrm {poly}!\log T). (In other words, the prover‚Äôs running time is essentially T for large computation times!)</p>
<p>The prover uses at most (\mathrm {poly}!\log T) processors.</p>
<p>The communication complexity and verifier complexity are both (\mathrm {poly}!\log T).</p>
<p>While the third property is standard in succinct arguments, the combination of all three is desirable as it gives a way to leverage moderate parallelism in favor of near-optimal running time. We emphasize that even a factor two overhead in the prover‚Äôs parallel running time is not allowed.</p>
<p>Our main results are the following, all for non-deterministic polynomial-time RAM computation. We construct (1) an (interactive) SPARK based solely on the existence of collision-resistant hash functions, and (2) a non-interactive SPARK based on any collision-resistant hash function and any SNARK with quasi-linear overhead (as satisfied by recent SNARK constructions).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We present a methodology to construct preprocessing zkSNARKs where the structured reference string (SRS) is universal and updatable. This exploits a novel use of holography [Babai et al., STOC 1991], where fast verification is achieved provided the statement being checked is given in encoded form.</p>
<p>We use our methodology to obtain a preprocessing zkSNARK where the SRS has linear size and arguments have constant size. Our construction improves on Sonic [Maller et al., CCS 2019], the prior state of the art in this setting, in all efficiency parameters: proving is an order of magnitude faster and verification is thrice as fast, even with smaller SRS size and argument size. Our construction is most efficient when instantiated in the algebraic group model (also used by Sonic), but we also demonstrate how to realize it under concrete knowledge assumptions. We implement and evaluate our construction.</p>
<p>The core of our preprocessing zkSNARK is an efficient algebraic holographic proof (AHP) for rank-1 constraint satisfiability (R1CS) that achieves linear proof length and constant query complexity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We present a new methodology to efficiently realize recursive composition of succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs). Prior to this work, the only known methodology relied on pairing-based SNARKs instantiated on cycles of pairing-friendly elliptic curves, an expensive algebraic object. Our methodology does not rely on any special algebraic objects and, moreover, achieves new desirable properties: it is post-quantum and it is transparent (the setup is public coin).</p>
<p>We exploit the fact that recursive composition is simpler for SNARKs with preprocessing, and the core of our work is obtaining a preprocessing zkSNARK for rank-1 constraint satisfiability (R1CS) that is post-quantum and transparent. We obtain this latter by establishing a connection between holography and preprocessing in the random oracle model, and then constructing a holographic proof for R1CS.</p>
<p>We experimentally validate our methodology, demonstrating feasibility in practice. (The full version of this work is available at https://ia.cr/2019/1076.)</p>
