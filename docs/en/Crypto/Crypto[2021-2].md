### Abstract
> Suppose that n players want to elect a random leader and they communicate by posting messages to a common broadcast channel. This problem is called leader election, and it is fundamental to the distributed systems and cryptography literature. Recently, it has attracted renewed interests due to its promised applications in decentralized environments. In a game theoretically fair leader election protocol, roughly speaking, we want that even a majority coalition cannot increase its own chance of getting elected, nor hurt the chance of any honest individual. The folklore tournament-tree protocol, which completes in logarithmically many rounds, can easily be shown to satisfy game theoretic security. To the best of our knowledge, no sub-logarithmic round protocol was known in the setting that we consider.

### Abstract
> Secure multi-party computation allows mutually distrusting parties to compute securely over their private data. However, guaranteeing output delivery to honest parties when the adversarial parties may abort the protocol has been a challenging objective. As a representative task, this work considers two-party coin-tossing protocols with guaranteed output delivery, a.k.a., fair coin-tossing.

### Abstract
> The inherent difficulty of maintaining stateful environments over long periods of time gave rise to the paradigm of serverless computing, where mostly stateless components are deployed on demand to handle computation tasks, and are torn down once their task is complete. Serverless architecture could offer the added benefit of improved resistance to targeted denial-of-service attacks, by hiding from the attacker the physical machines involved in the protocol until after they complete their work. Realizing such protection, however, requires that the protocol only uses stateless parties, where each party sends only one message and never needs to speaks again. Perhaps the most famous example of this style of protocols is the Nakamoto consensus protocol used in Bitcoin: A peer can win the right to produce the next block by running a local lottery (mining) while staying covert. Once the right has been won, it is executed by sending a single message. After that, the physical entity never needs to send more messages.

### Abstract
> Existing approaches to secure multiparty computation (MPC) require all participants to commit to the entire duration of the protocol. As interest in MPC continues to grow, it is inevitable that there will be a desire to use it to evaluate increasingly complex functionalities, resulting in computations spanning several hours or days.

### Abstract
> We give constructions of three-round secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols for general functions that make black-box use of a two-round oblivious transfer (OT). For the case of semi-honest adversaries, we make use of a two-round, semi-honest secure OT in the plain model. This resolves the round-complexity of black-box (semi-honest) MPC protocols from minimal assumptions and answers an open question of Applebaum et al. (ITCS 2020). For the case of malicious adversaries, we make use of a two-round maliciously-secure OT in the common random/reference string model that satisfies a (mild) variant of adaptive security for the receiver.

### Abstract
> We consider the question of minimizing the round complexity of secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols that make a black-box use of simple cryptographic primitives with security against any number of malicious parties. In the plain model, previous black-box protocols required a high constant number of rounds (>15). This is far from the known lower bound of 4 rounds for protocols with black-box simulators.

### Abstract
> The best known n party unconditional multiparty computation protocols with an optimal corruption threshold communicates O(n) field elements per gate. This has been the case even in the semi-honest setting despite over a decade of research on communication complexity in this setting. Going to the slightly sub-optimal corruption setting, the work of Damgård, Ishai, and Krøigaard (EUROCRYPT 2010) provided the first protocol for a single circuit achieving communication complexity of \(O(\log |C|)\) elements per gate. While a number of works have improved upon this result, obtaining a protocol with O(1) field elements per gate has been an open problem.

### Abstract
> Non-interactive secure multiparty computation (NIMPC) is a variant of secure computation which allows each of n players to send only a single message depending on his input and correlated randomness. Abelian programs, which can realize any symmetric function, are defined as functions on the sum of the players’ inputs over an abelian group and provide useful functionalities for real-world applications. We improve and extend the previous results in the following ways:

### Abstract
> We construct the first efficient, unconditionally secure MPC protocol that only requires black-box access to a non-commutative ring R. Previous results in the same setting were efficient only either for a constant number of corruptions or when computing branching programs and formulas. Our techniques are based on a generalization of Shamir’s secret sharing to non-commutative rings, which we derive from the work on Reed Solomon codes by Quintin, Barbier and Chabot (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2013). When the center of the ring contains a set \(A = \{\alpha _0, \ldots , \alpha _n\}\) such that \(\forall i \ne j, \alpha _i \,-\, \alpha _j \in R^*\), the resulting secret sharing scheme is strongly multiplicative and we can generalize existing constructions over finite fields without much trouble.

### Abstract
> A universal circuit (UC) is a general-purpose circuit that can simulate arbitrary circuits (up to a certain size n). Valiant provides a k-way recursive construction of UCs (STOC 1976), where k tunes the complexity of the recursion. More concretely, Valiant gives theoretical constructions of 2-way and 4-way UCs of asymptotic (multiplicative) sizes \(5n\log n\) and \(4.75 n\log n\) respectively, which matches the asymptotic lower bound \(\varOmega (n\log n)\) up to some constant factor.

### Abstract
> Many recent private set intersection (PSI) protocols encode input sets as polynomials. We consider the more general notion of an oblivious key-value store (OKVS), which is a data structure that compactly represents a desired mapping \(k_i \mapsto v_i\). When the \(v_i\) values are random, the OKVS data structure hides the \(k_i\) values that were used to generate it. The simplest (and size-optimal) OKVS is a polynomial p that is chosen using interpolation such that \(p(k_i)=v_i\).

### Abstract
> We propose a multi-party computation (MPC) protocol over \(\mathbb {Z}_{2^k}\) secure against actively corrupted majority from somewhat homomorphic encryption. The main technical contributions are: (i) a new efficient packing method for \(\mathbb {Z}_{2^k}\)-messages in lattice-based somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes, (ii) a simpler reshare protocol for level-dependent packings, (iii) a more efficient zero-knowledge proof of plaintext knowledge on cyclotomic rings \({\mathbb Z}[X]/\varPhi _M(X)\) with M being a prime. Integrating them, our protocol shows from 2.2x upto 4.8x improvements in amortized communication costs compared to the previous best results. Our techniques not only improve the efficiency of MPC over \(\mathbb {Z}_{2^k}\) considerably, but also provide a toolkit that can be leveraged when designing other cryptographic primitives over \(\mathbb {Z}_{2^k}\).

### Abstract
> We consider the efficiency of protocols for secure multiparty computation (MPC) with a dishonest majority. A popular approach for the design of such protocols is to employ preprocessing. Before the inputs are known, the parties generate correlated secret randomness, which is consumed by a fast and possibly “information-theoretic” online protocol.

### Abstract
> Yao’s garbling scheme is one of the most fundamental cryptographic constructions. Lindell and Pinkas (Journal of Cryptograhy 2009) gave a formal proof of security in the selective setting where the adversary chooses the challenge inputs before seeing the garbled circuit assuming secure symmetric-key encryption (and hence one-way functions). This was followed by results, both positive and negative, concerning its security in the, stronger, adaptive setting. Applebaum et al. (Crypto 2013) showed that it cannot satisfy adaptive security as is, due to a simple incompressibility argument. Jafargholi and Wichs (TCC 2017) considered a natural adaptation of Yao’s scheme (where the output mapping is sent in the online phase, together with the garbled input) that circumvents this negative result, and proved that it is adaptively secure, at least for shallow circuits. In particular, they showed that for the class of circuits of depth \(\delta \), the loss in security is at most exponential in \(\delta \). The above results all concern the simulation-based notion of security.

### Abstract
> We study when (dual) Vandermonde systems of the form \(\mathbf {V} _T^{{(\intercal )}} \cdot \mathbf {z} = s\cdot \mathbf {w}\) admit a solution \(\mathbf {z}\) over a ring \(\mathcal {R}\), where \(\mathbf {V} _T\) is the Vandermonde matrix defined by a set T and where the “slack” s is a measure of the quality of solutions. To this end, we propose the notion of (s, t)-subtractive sets over a ring \(\mathcal {R}\), with the property that if S is (s, t)-subtractive then the above (dual) Vandermonde systems defined by any t-subset \(T \subseteq S\) are solvable over \(\mathcal {R}\). The challenge is then to find large sets S while minimising (the norm of) s when given a ring \(\mathcal {R}\).

> Many of the recent advanced lattice-based \(\varSigma \)-/public-coin honest verifier (HVZK) interactive protocols based on the techniques developed by Lyubashevsky (Asiacrypt’09, Eurocrypt’12) can be transformed into a non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof in the random oracle model (ROM) using the Fiat-Shamir transform. Unfortunately, although they are known to be secure in the classical ROM, existing proof techniques are incapable of proving them secure in the quantum ROM (QROM). Alternatively, while we could instead rely on the Unruh transform (Eurocrypt’15), the resulting QROM secure NIZK will incur a large overhead compared to the underlying interactive protocol.

### Abstract
> In a set membership proof, the public information consists of a set of elements and a commitment. The prover then produces a zero-knowledge proof showing that the commitment is indeed to some element from the set. This primitive is closely related to concepts like ring signatures and “one-out-of-many” proofs that underlie many anonymity and privacy protocols. The main result of this work is a new succinct lattice-based set membership proof whose size is logarithmic in the size of the set.

### Abstract
> We define and construct Deniable Fully Homomorphic Encryption based on the Learning With Errors (LWE) polynomial hardness assumption. Deniable FHE enables storing encrypted data in the cloud to be processed securely without decryption, maintaining deniability of the encrypted data, as well the prevention of vote-buying in electronic voting schemes where encrypted votes can be tallied without decryption.

### Abstract
> We study several strengthening of classical circular security assumptions which were recently introduced in four new lattice-based constructions of indistinguishability obfuscation: Brakerski-Döttling-Garg-Malavolta (Eurocrypt 2020), Gay-Pass (STOC 2021), Brakerski-Döttling-Garg-Malavolta (Eprint 2020) and Wee-Wichs (Eprint 2020).

### Abstract
> The LWE problem with its ring variants is today the most prominent candidate for building efficient public key cryptosystems resistant to quantum computers. NTRU-type cryptosystems use an LWE-type variant with small max-norm secrets, usually with ternary coefficients from the set \(\{-1,0,1\}\). The presumably best attack on these schemes is a hybrid attack that combines lattice reduction techniques with Odlyzko’s Meet-in-the-Middle approach. Odlyzko’s algorithm is a classical combinatorial attack that for key space size \(\mathcal{S}\) runs in time \(\mathcal{S}^{0.5}\). We substantially improve on this Meet-in-the-Middle approach, using the representation technique developed for subset sum algorithms. Asymptotically, our heuristic Meet-in-the-Middle attack runs in time roughly \(\mathcal{S}^{0.25}\), which also beats the \(\mathcal{S}^{\frac{1}{3}}\) complexity of the best known quantum algorithm.

### Abstract
> This work provides a systematic investigation of the use of approximate enumeration oracles in BKZ, building on recent technical progress on speeding-up lattice enumeration: relaxing (the search radius of) enumeration and extended preprocessing which preprocesses in a larger rank than the enumeration rank. First, we heuristically justify that relaxing enumeration with certain extreme pruning asymptotically achieves an exponential speed-up for reaching the same root Hermite factor (RHF). Second, we perform simulations/experiments to validate this and the performance for relaxed enumeration with numerically optimised pruning for both regular and extended preprocessing.

### Abstract
> The lll algorithm is a polynomial-time algorithm for reducing d-dimensional lattice with exponential approximation factor. Currently, the most efficient variant of lll, by Neumaier and Stehlé, has a theoretical running time in \(d^4\cdot B^{1+o\left( 1\right) }\) where B is the bitlength of the entries, but has never been implemented. This work introduces new asymptotically fast, parallel, yet heuristic, reduction algorithms with their optimized implementations. Our algorithms are recursive and fully exploit fast matrix multiplication. We experimentally demonstrate that by carefully controlling the floating-point precision during the recursion steps, we can reduce euclidean lattices of rank d in time \(\tilde{O}(d^\omega \cdot C)\), i.e., almost a constant number of matrix multiplications, where \(\omega \) is the exponent of matrix multiplication and C is the log of the condition number of the matrix. For cryptographic applications, C is close to B, while it can be up to d times larger in the worst case. It improves the running-time of the state-of-the-art implementation fplll by a multiplicative factor of order \(d^2\cdot B\). Further, we show that we can reduce structured lattices, the so-called knapsack lattices, in time \(\tilde{O}(d^{\omega -1}\cdot C)\) with a progressive reduction strategy. Besides allowing reducing huge lattices, our implementation can break several instances of Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes based on large integers in dimension 2,230 with 4 millions of bits.

### Abstract
> In two of the main areas of post-quantum cryptography, based on lattices and codes, nearest neighbor techniques have been used to speed up state-of-the-art cryptanalytic algorithms, and to obtain the lowest asymptotic cost estimates to date [May–Ozerov, Eurocrypt’15; Becker–Ducas–Gama–Laarhoven, SODA’16]. These upper bounds are useful for assessing the security of cryptosystems against known attacks, but to guarantee long-term security one would like to have closely matching lower bounds, showing that improvements on the algorithmic side will not drastically reduce the security in the future. As existing lower bounds from the nearest neighbor literature do not apply to the nearest neighbor problems appearing in this context, one might wonder whether further speedups to these cryptanalytic algorithms can still be found by only improving the nearest neighbor subroutines.
