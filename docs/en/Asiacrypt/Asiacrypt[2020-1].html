<blockquote>
<p>Since the celebrated work of Impagliazzo and Rudich (STOC 1989), a number of black-box impossibility results have been established. However, these works only ruled out classical black-box reductions among cryptographic primitives. Therefore it may be possible to overcome these impossibility results by using quantum reductions. To exclude such a possibility, we have to extend these impossibility results to the quantum setting. In this paper, we study black-box impossibility in the quantum setting.</p>
<p>We first formalize a quantum counterpart of fully-black-box reduction following the formalization by Reingold, Trevisan and Vadhan (TCC 2004). Then we prove that there is no quantum fully-black-box reduction from collision-resistant hash functions to one-way permutations (or even trapdoor permutations). We take both of classical and quantum implementations of primitives into account. This is an extension to the quantum setting of the work of Simon (Eurocrypt 1998) who showed a similar result in the classical setting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(\mathsf {Gimli}) is a family of cryptographic primitives (both a hash function and an AEAD scheme) that has been selected for the second round of the NIST competition for standardizing new lightweight designs. The candidate (\mathsf {Gimli}) is based on the permutation (\mathsf {Gimli}), which was presented at CHES 2017. In this paper, we study the security of both the permutation and the constructions that are based on it. We exploit the slow diffusion in (\mathsf {Gimli}) and its internal symmetries to build, for the first time, a distinguisher on the full permutation of complexity (2^{64}). We also provide a practical distinguisher on 23 out of the full 24 rounds of (\mathsf {Gimli}) that has been implemented.</p>
<p>Next, we give (full state) collision and semi-free-start collision attacks on (\mathsf {Gimli})-Hash, reaching respectively up to 12 and 18 rounds. On the practical side, we compute a collision on 8-round (\mathsf {Gimli})-Hash. In the quantum setting, these attacks reach 2 more rounds. Finally, we perform the first study of linear trails in the permutation, and we propose differential-linear cryptanalysis that reach up to 17 rounds of (\mathsf {Gimli}).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We introduce a new signature scheme, SQISign, (for Short Quaternion and Isogeny Signature) from isogeny graphs of supersingular elliptic curves. The signature scheme is derived from a new one-round, high soundness, interactive identification protocol. Targeting the post-quantum NIST-1 level of security, our implementation results in signatures of 204 bytes, secret keys of 16 bytes and public keys of 64 bytes. In particular, the signature and public key sizes combined are an order of magnitude smaller than all other post-quantum signature schemes. On a modern workstation, our implementation in C takes 0.6 s for key generation, 2.5 s for signing, and 50 ms for verification.</p>
<p>While the soundness of the identification protocol follows from classical assumptions, the zero-knowledge property relies on the second main contribution of this paper. We introduce a new algorithm to find an isogeny path connecting two given supersingular elliptic curves of known endomorphism rings. A previous algorithm to solve this problem, due to Kohel, Lauter, Petit and Tignol, systematically reveals paths from the input curves to a ‚Äòspecial‚Äô curve. This leakage would break the zero-knowledge property of the protocol. Our algorithm does not directly reveal such a path, and subject to a new computational assumption, we prove that the resulting identification protocol is zero-knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We revisit the problem of proving that a user algorithm selected and correctly used a truly random seed in the generation of her cryptographic key. A first approach was proposed in 2002 by Juels and Guajardo for the validation of RSA secret keys. We present a new security model and general tools to efficiently prove that a private key was generated at random according to a prescribed process, without revealing any further information about the private key.</p>
<p>We give a generic protocol for all key-generation algorithms based on probabilistic circuits and prove its security. We also propose a new protocol for factoring-based cryptography that we prove secure in the aforementioned model. This latter relies on a new efficient zero-knowledge argument for the double discrete logarithm problem that achieves an exponential improvement in communication complexity compared to the state of the art, and is of independent interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Naor-Yung paradigm is a well-known technique that constructs IND-CCA2-secure encryption schemes by means of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs satisfying a notion of simulation-soundness. Until recently, it was an open problem to instantiate it under the sole Learning-With-Errors ((\mathsf {LWE})) assumption without relying on random oracles. While the recent results of Canetti et al. (STOC‚Äô19) and Peikert-Shiehian (Crypto‚Äô19) provide a solution to this problem by applying the Fiat-Shamir transform in the standard model, the resulting constructions are extremely inefficient as they proceed via a reduction to an NP-complete problem. In this paper, we give a direct, non-generic method for instantiating Naor-Yung under the (\mathsf {LWE}) assumption outside the random oracle model. Specifically, we give a direct construction of an unbounded simulation-sound NIZK argument system which, for carefully chosen parameters, makes it possible to express the equality of plaintexts encrypted under different keys in Regev‚Äôs cryptosystem. We also give a variant of our argument that provides tight security. As an application, we obtain an (\mathsf {LWE})-based public-key encryption scheme for which we can prove (tight) key-dependent message security under chosen-ciphertext attacks in the standard model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Public-key encryption (PKE) schemes or key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) are fundamental cryptographic building blocks to realize secure communication protocols. There are several known transformations that generically turn weakly secure schemes into strongly (i.e., IND-CCA) secure ones. While most of these transformations require the weakly secure scheme to provide perfect correctness, Hofheinz, H√∂velmanns, and Kiltz (HHK) (TCC 2017) have recently shown that variants of the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform can work with schemes that have negligible correctness error in the (quantum) random oracle model (QROM). Many recent schemes in the NIST post-quantum competition (PQC) use variants of these transformations. Some of their CPA-secure versions even have a non-negligible correctness error and so the techniques of HHK cannot be applied.</p>
<p>In this work, we study the setting of generically transforming PKE schemes with potentially large, i.e., non-negligible, correctness error to ones having negligible correctness error. While there have been previous treatments in an asymptotic setting by Dwork et al. (EUROCRYPT 2004), our goal is to come up with practically efficient compilers in a concrete setting and apply them in two different contexts: firstly, we show how to generically transform weakly secure deterministic or randomized PKEs into CCA-secure KEMs in the (Q)ROM using variants of HHK. This applies to essentially all candidates to the NIST PQC based on lattices and codes with non-negligible error, for which we provide an extensive analysis. We thereby show that it improves some of the code-based candidates. Secondly, we study puncturable KEMs in terms of the Bloom Filter KEM (BFKEM) proposed by Derler et al. (EUROCRYPT 2018) which inherently have a non-negligible correctness error. BFKEMs are a building block to construct fully forward-secret zero round-trip time (0-RTT) key-exchange protocols. In particular, we show how to achieve the first post-quantum secure BFKEM generically from lattices and codes by applying our techniques to identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes with (non-)negligible correctness error.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Public key encryption (PKE) schemes are usually deployed in an open system with numerous users. In practice, it is common that some users are corrupted. A PKE scheme is said to be receiver selective opening (RSO) secure if it can still protect messages transmitted to uncorrupted receivers after the adversary corrupts some receivers and learns their secret keys. This is usually defined by requiring the existence of a simulator that can simulate the view of the adversary given only the opened messages. Existing works construct RSO secure PKE schemes in a single-challenge setting, where the adversary can only obtain one challenge ciphertext for each public key. However, in practice, it is preferable to have a PKE scheme with RSO security in the multi-challenge setting, where public keys can be used to encrypt multiple messages. In this work, we explore the possibility of achieving PKE schemes with receiver selective opening security in the multi-challenge setting. Our contributions are threefold. First, we demonstrate that PKE schemes with RSO security in the single-challenge setting are not necessarily RSO secure in the multi-challenge setting. Then, we show that it is impossible to achieve RSO security for PKE schemes if the number of challenge ciphertexts under each public key is a priori unbounded. In particular, we prove that no PKE scheme can be RSO secure in the k-challenge setting (i.e., the adversary can obtain k challenge ciphertexts for each public key) if its secret key contains less than k bits. On the positive side, we give a concrete construction of PKE scheme with RSO security in the k-challenge setting, where the ratio of the secret key length to k approaches the lower bound 1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The goal of white-box cryptography is to provide security even when the cryptographic implementation is executed in adversarially controlled environments. White-box implementations nowadays appear in commercial products such as mobile payment applications, e.g., those certified by Mastercard. Interestingly, there, white-box cryptography is championed as a tool for secure storage of payment tokens, and importantly, the white-boxed storage functionality is bound to a hardware functionality to prevent code-lifting attacks.</p>
<p>In this paper, we show that the approach of using hardware-binding and obfuscation for secure storage is conceptually sound. Following security specifications by Mastercard and also EMVCo, we first define security for a white-box key derivation functions (WKDF) that is bound to a hardware functionality. WKDFs with hardware-binding model a secure storage functionality, as the WKDFs in turn can be used to derive encryption keys for secure storage. We then provide a proof-of-concept construction of WKDFs based on pseudorandom functions (PRF) and obfuscation. To show that our use of cryptographic primitives is sound, we perform a cryptographic analysis and reduce the security of our WKDF to the cryptographic assumptions of indistinguishability obfuscation and PRF-security. The hardware-functionality that our WKDF is bound to is a PRF-like functionality. Obfuscation helps us to hide the secret key used for the verification, essentially emulating a signature functionality as is provided by the Android key store.</p>
<p>We rigorously define the required security properties of a hardware-bound white-box payment application (WPAY) for generating and encrypting valid payment requests. We construct a WPAY, which uses a WKDF as a secure building block. We thereby show that a WKDF can be securely combined with any secure symmetric encryption scheme, including those based on standard ciphers such as AES.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Circular security is the most elementary form of key-dependent message (KDM) security, which allows us to securely encrypt only a copy of secret key bits. In this work, we show that circular security is complete for KDM security in the sense that an encryption scheme satisfying this security notion can be transformed into one satisfying KDM security with respect to all functions computable by a-priori bounded-size circuits (bounded-KDM security). This result holds in the presence of any number of keys and in any of secret-key/public-key and CPA/CCA settings. Such a completeness result was previously shown by Applebaum (EUROCRYPT 2011) for KDM security with respect to projection functions (projection-KDM security) that allows us to securely encrypt both a copy and a negation of secret key bits. Besides amplifying the strength of KDM security, our transformation in fact can start from an encryption scheme satisfying circular security against CPA attacks and results in one satisfying bounded-KDM security against CCA attacks. This result improves the recent result by Kitagawa and Matsuda (TCC 2019) showing a CPA-to-CCA transformation for KDM secure public-key encryption schemes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A multi-recipient key encapsulation mechanism, or (\mathsf {m}\mathsf {KEM}), provides a scalable solution to securely communicating to a large group, and offers savings in both bandwidth and computational cost compared to the trivial solution of communicating with each member individually. All prior works on (\mathsf {m}\mathsf {KEM}) are only limited to classical assumptions and, although some generic constructions are known, they all require specific properties that are not shared by most post-quantum schemes. In this work, we first provide a simple and efficient generic construction of (\mathsf {m}\mathsf {KEM}) that can be instantiated from versatile assumptions, including post-quantum ones. We then study these (\mathsf {m}\mathsf {KEM}) instantiations at a practical level using 8 post-quantum (\mathsf {KEM})s (which are lattice and isogeny-based NIST candidates), and CSIDH, and show that compared to the trivial solution, our (\mathsf {m}\mathsf {KEM}) offers savings of at least one order of magnitude in the bandwidth, and make encryption time shorter by a factor ranging from 1.92 to 35. Additionally, we show that by combining (\mathsf {m}\mathsf {KEM}) with the TreeKEM protocol used by MLS ‚Äì an IETF draft for secure group messaging ‚Äì we obtain significant bandwidth savings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>HQC is an IND-CCA2 KEM running for standardization in NIST‚Äôs post-quantum cryptography project and has advanced to the second round. It is a code-based scheme in the class of public key encryptions, with given sets of parameters spanning NIST security strength 1, 3 and 5, corresponding to 128, 192 and 256 bits of classic security.</p>
<p>In this paper we present an attack recovering the secret key of an HQC instance named hqc-256-1. The attack requires a single precomputation performed once and then never again. The online attack on an HQC instance then submits about (2^{64}) special ciphertexts for decryption (obtained from the precomputation) and a phase of analysis studies the subset of ciphertexts that are not correctly decrypted. In this phase, the secret key of the HQC instance is determined.</p>
<p>The overall complexity is estimated to be (2^{246}) if the attacker balances the costs of precomputation and post-processing, thereby claiming a successful attack on hqc-256-1 in the NIST setting. If we allow the precomputation cost to be (2^{254}), which is below exhaustive key search on a 256 bit secret key, the computational complexity of the later parts can be no more than (2^{64}). This is a setting relevant to practical security since the large precomputation needs to be done only once. Also, we note that the complexity of the precomputation can be lower if the online attack is allowed to submit more than (2^{64}) ciphertexts for decryption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ARX algorithms are a class of symmetric-key algorithms constructed by Addition, Rotation, and XOR, which achieve the best software performances in low-end microcontrollers. To evaluate the resistance of an ARX cipher against differential cryptanalysis and its variants, the recent automated methods employ constraint satisfaction solvers, such as SMT solvers, to search for optimal characteristics. The main difficulty to formulate this search as a constraint satisfaction problem is obtaining the differential models of the non-linear operations, that is, the constraints describing the differential probability of each non-linear operation of the cipher. While an efficient bit-vector differential model was obtained for the modular addition with two variable inputs, no differential model for the modular addition by a constant has been proposed so far, preventing ARX ciphers including this operation from being evaluated with automated methods.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present the first bit-vector differential model for the n-bit modular addition by a constant input. Our model contains (O(\log _2(n))) basic bit-vector constraints and describes the binary logarithm of the differential probability. We also represent an SMT-based automated method to look for differential characteristics of ARX, including constant additions, and we provide an open-source tool ArxPy to find ARX differential characteristics in a fully automated way. To provide some examples, we have searched for related-key differential characteristics of TEA, XTEA, HIGHT, and LEA, obtaining better results than previous works. Our differential model and our automated tool allow cipher designers to select the best constant inputs for modular additions and cryptanalysts to evaluate the resistance of ARX ciphers against differential attacks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Impossible differentials cryptanalysis and impossible polytopic cryptanalysis are the most effective approaches to estimate the security of block ciphers. However, the previous automatic search methods of their distinguishers, impossible differentials and impossible polytopic transitions, neither consider the impact of key schedule in the single-key setting and the differential property of large S-boxes, nor apply to the block ciphers with variable rotations.</p>
<p>Thus, unlike previous methods which focus on the propagation of the difference or s-difference, we redefine the impossible differentials and impossible ((s+1))-polytopic transitions according to the propagation of state, which allow us to break through those limitations of the previous methods. Theoretically, we prove that traditional impossible differentials and impossible ((s+1))-polytopic transitions are equivalent to part of our redefinitions, which have advantages from broader view. Technically, we renew the automatic search model and design an SAT-based tool to evaluate our redefined impossible differentials and impossible ((s+1))-polytopic transitions efficiently.</p>
<p>As a result, for GIFT64, we get the 6-round impossible differentials which cannot be detected by all previous tools. For PRINTcipher, we propose the first modeling method for the key-dependent permutation and key-dependent S-box. For MISTY1, we derive 902 4-round impossible differentials by exploiting the differential property of S-boxes. For RC5, we present the first modeling method for the variable rotation and get 2.5-round impossible differentials for each version of it. More remarkable, our tool can be used to evaluate the security of given cipher against the impossible differentials, and we prove that there exists no 5-round 1 input active word and 1 output active word impossible differentials for AES-128 even consider the relations of 3-round keys. Besides, we also get the impossible ((s+1))-polytopic transitions for PRINTcipher, GIFT64, PRESENT, and RC5, all of which can cover more rounds than their corresponding impossible differentials as far as we know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since it was proposed in 2015 as a generalization of integral properties, the division property has evolved into a powerful tool for probing the structures of Boolean functions whose algebraic normal forms are not available. We capture the most essential elements for the detection of division properties from a pure algebraic perspective, proposing a technique named as monomial prediction, which can be employed to determine the presence or absence of a monomial in any product of the coordinate functions of a vectorial Boolean function (\textit{\textbf{f}}) by counting the number of the so-called monomial trails across a sequence of simpler functions whose composition is (\textit{\textbf{f}}). Under the framework of the monomial prediction, we formally prove that most algorithms for detecting division properties in literature raise no false alarms but may miss. We also establish the equivalence between the monomial prediction and the three-subset bit-based division property without unknown subset presented at EUROCRYPT 2020, and show that these two techniques are perfectly accurate.</p>
<p>The monomial prediction technique can be regarded as a purification of the definitions of the division properties without resorting to external multisets. This algebraic formulation gives more insights into division properties and inspires new search strategies. With the monomial prediction, we obtain the exact algebraic degrees of Trivium up to 834 rounds for the first time. In the context of cube attacks, we are able to explore a larger search space in limited time and recover the exact algebraic normal forms of complex superpolies with the help of a divide-and-conquer strategy. As a result, we identify more cubes with smaller dimensions, leading to improvements of some near-optimal attacks against 840-, 841- and 842-round Trivium.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Algebraically simple PRFs, ciphers, or cryptographic hash functions are becoming increasingly popular, for example due to their attractive properties for MPC and new proof systems (SNARKs, STARKs, among many others).</p>
<p>In this paper, we focus on the algebraically simple construction MiMC, which became an attractive cryptanalytic target due to its simplicity, but also due to its use as a baseline in a competition for more recent algorithms exploring this design space.</p>
<p>For the first time, we are able to describe key-recovery attacks on all full-round versions of MiMC over ({\mathbb {F}}_{2^n}), requiring half the code book. In the chosen-ciphertext scenario, recovering the key from this data for the n-bit full version of MiMC takes the equivalent of less than (2^{n-\log _2(n) +1}) calls to MiMC and negligible amounts of memory.</p>
<p>The attack procedure is a generalization of higher-order differential cryptanalysis, and it is based on two main ingredients. First, we present a higher-order distinguisher which exploits the fact that the algebraic degree of MiMC grows significantly slower than originally believed. Secondly, we describe an approach to turn this distinguisher into a key-recovery attack without guessing the full subkey. Finally, we show that approximately (\lceil \log _3(2\cdot R)\rceil ) more rounds (where (R = \lceil n \cdot \log _3(2)\rceil ) is the current number of rounds of MiMC-n/n) can be necessary and sufficient to restore the security against the key-recovery attack presented here.</p>
<p>The attack has been practically verified on toy versions of MiMC. Note that our attack does not affect the security of MiMC over prime fields.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this paper, we show how to significantly improve algebraic techniques for solving the MinRank problem, which is ubiquitous in multivariate and rank metric code based cryptography. In the case of the structured MinRank instances arising in the latter, we build upon a recent breakthrough [11] showing that algebraic attacks outperform the combinatorial ones that were considered state of the art up until now. Through a slight modification of this approach, we completely avoid Gr√∂bner bases computations for certain parameters and are left only with solving linear systems. This does not only substantially improve the complexity, but also gives a convincing argument as to why algebraic techniques work in this case. When used against the second round NIST-PQC candidates ROLLO-I-128/192/256, our new attack has bit complexity respectively 71, 87, and 151, to be compared to 117, 144, and 197 as obtained in [11]. The linear systems arise from the nullity of the maximal minors of a certain matrix associated to the algebraic modeling. We also use a similar approach to improve the algebraic MinRank solvers for the usual MinRank problem. When applied against the second round NIST-PQC candidates GeMSS and Rainbow, our attack has a complexity that is very close to or even slightly better than those of the best known attacks so far. Note that these latter attacks did not rely on MinRank techniques since the MinRank approach used to give complexities that were far away from classical security levels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tweakable block ciphers (TBCs) have been established as a valuable replacement for many applications of classical block ciphers. While several dedicated TBCs have been proposed in the previous years, generic constructions that build a TBC from a classical block cipher are still highly useful, for example, to reuse an existing implementation. However, most generic constructions need an additional call to either the block cipher or a universal hash function to process the tweak, which limited their efficiency.</p>
<p>To address this deficit, Bao et al. proposed Tweak-aNd-Tweak (TNT) at EUROCRYPT‚Äô20. Their construction chains three calls to independent keyed permutations and adds the unmodified tweak to the state in between the calls. They further suggested an efficient instantiation TNT-AES that was based on round-reduced AES for each of the permutations. Their work could prove 2n/3-bit security for their construction, where n is the block size in bits. Though, in the absence of an upper bound, their analysis had to consider all possible attack vectors with up to (2^n) time, data, and memory. Still, closing the gap between both bounds remained a highly interesting research question.</p>
<p>In this work, we show that a variant of Mennink‚Äôs distinguisher on CLRW2 with (O(\sqrt{n} 2^{3n/4})) data and (O(2^{3n/2})) time from TCC‚Äô18 also applies to TNT. We reduce its time complexity to (O(\sqrt{n} 2^{3n/4})), show the existence of a second similar distinguisher, and demonstrate how to transform the distinguisher to a key-recovery attack on from an impossible differential. From a constructive point of view, we adapt the rigorous STPRP analysis of CLRW2 by Jha and Nandi to show (O(2^{3n/4})) TPRP security for TNT. Thus, we move towards closing the gap between the previous proof and attacks for TNT as well as its proposed instance.</p>

<p>In CRYPTO 2015, Cogliati et al. have proposed one-round tweakable Even-Mansour (1-TEM) cipher constructed out of a single n-bit public permutation (\pi ) and a uniform and almost XOR-universal hash function H as ((k, t, x) \mapsto \textsf {H}_k(t) \oplus \pi (\textsf {H}_k(t) \oplus x)), where t is the tweak, and x is the n-bit message. Authors have shown that its two-round extension, which we refer to as 2-TEM, obtained by cascading 2-independent instances of the construction gives 2n/3-bit security and r-round cascading gives (rn/r+2)-bit security. In ASIACRYPT 2015, Cogliati and Seurin have shown that four-round tweakable Even-Mansour cipher, which we refer to as 4-TEM, constructed out of four independent n-bit permutations (\pi _1, \pi _2, \pi _3, \pi _4) and two independent n-bit keys (k_1, k_2), defined as</p>

In this paper, we have shown that if we replace two independent permutations of 2-TEM (Cogliati et al., CRYPTO 2015) with a single n-bit public permutation, then the resultant construction still guarantees security upto (2^{2n/3}) adversarial queries. Using the results derived therein, we also show that replacing the permutation ((\pi _4, \pi _3)) with ((\pi _1, \pi _2)) in the above equation preserves security upto (2^{2n/3}) adversarial queries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fresh rekeying is a well-established method to protect a primitive or mode against side-channel attacks: an easy to protect but cryptographically not so involved function generates a subkey from the master key, and this subkey is then used for the block encryption of a single or a few messages. It is an efficient way to achieve side-channel protection, but current solutions only achieve birthday bound security in the block size of the cipher and thus halve its security (except if more involved primitives are employed). We present generalized solutions to parallel block cipher rekeying that, for the first time, achieve security beyond the birthday bound in the block size n. The first solution involves, next to the subkey generation, one multiplication and the core block cipher call and achieves (2^{2n/3}) security. The second solution makes two block cipher calls, and achieves optimal (2^n) security. Our third solution uses a slightly larger subkey generation function but requires no adaptations to the core encryption and also achieves optimal security. The construction seamlessly generalizes to permutation based fresh rekeying. Central to our schemes is the observation that fresh rekeying and generic tweakable block cipher design are two very related topics, and we can take lessons from the advanced results in the latter to improve our understanding and development of the former. We subsequently use these rekeying schemes in a constructive manner to deliver three authenticated encryption modes that achieve beyond birthday bound security and are easy to protect against side-channel attacks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The tight security bound of the KAC (Key-Alternating Cipher) construction whose round permutations are independent from each other has been well studied. Then a natural question is how the security bound will change when we use fewer permutations in a KAC construction. In CRYPTO 2014, Chen et al. proved that 2-round KAC with a single permutation (2KACSP) has the same security level as the classic one (i.e., 2-round KAC). But we still know little about the security bound of incompletely-independent KAC constructions with more than 2 rounds. In this paper, we will show that a similar result also holds for 3-round case. More concretely, we prove that 3-round KAC with a single permutation (3KACSP) is secure up to (\varTheta (2^{\frac{3n}{4}})) queries, which also caps the security of 3-round KAC. To avoid the cumbersome graphical illustration used in Chen et al.‚Äôs work, a new representation is introduced to characterize the underlying combinatorial problem. Benefited from it, we can handle the knotty dependence in a modular way, and also show a plausible way to study the security of rKACSP. Technically, we abstract a type of problems capturing the intrinsic randomness of rKACSP construction, and then propose a high-level framework to handle such problems. Furthermore, our proof techniques show some evidence that for any r, rKACSP has the same security level as the classic r-round KAC in random permutation model.</p>

<p>In this paper, we prove that the nonce-based enhanced hash-then-mask MAC ((\mathsf {nEHtM})) is secure up to (2^{\frac{3n}{4}}) MAC queries and (2^n) verification queries (ignoring logarithmic factors) as long as the number of faulty queries (\mu ) is below (2^\frac{3n}{8}), significantly improving the previous bound by Dutta et al. Even when (\mu ) goes beyond (2^{\frac{3n}{8}}), (\mathsf {nEHtM}) enjoys graceful degradation of security.</p>
<p>The second result is to prove the security of PRF-based (\mathsf {nEHtM}); when (\mathsf {nEHtM}) is based on an n-to-s bit random function for a fixed size s such that (1\le s\le n), it is proved to be secure up to any number of MAC queries and (2^s) verification queries, if (1) (s=n) and (\mu &lt;2^{\frac{n}{2}}) or (2) (\frac{n}{2}&lt;s&lt;2^{n-s}) and (\mu &lt;\max {2^{\frac{s}{2}},2^{n-s}}), or (3) (s\le \frac{n}{2}) and (\mu &lt;2^{\frac{n}{2}}). This result leads to the security proof of truncated (\mathsf {nEHtM}) that returns only s bits of the original tag since a truncated permutation can be seen as a pseudorandom function. In particular, when (s\le \frac{2n}{3}), the truncated (\mathsf {nEHtM}) is secure up to (2^{n-\frac{s}{2}}) MAC queries and (2^s) verification queries as long as (\mu &lt;\min {2^{\frac{n}{2}},2^{n-s}}). For example, when (s=\frac{n}{2}) (resp. (s=\frac{n}{4})), the truncated (\mathsf {nEHtM}) is secure up to (2^{\frac{3n}{4}}) (resp. (2^{\frac{7n}{8}})) MAC queries. So truncation might provide better provable security than the original (\mathsf {nEHtM}) with respect to the number of MAC queries.</p>

<p>We consider the security of two of the most commonly used cryptographic primitives‚Äîmessage authentication codes (MACs) and pseudorandom functions (PRFs)‚Äîin a multi-user setting with adaptive corruption. Whereas is it well known that any secure MAC or PRF is also multi-user secure under adaptive corruption, the trivial reduction induces a security loss that is linear in the number of users.</p>
<p>Our main result shows that black-box reductions from ‚Äústandard‚Äù assumptions cannot be used to provide a tight, or even a linear-preserving, security reduction for adaptive multi-user secure deterministic stateless MACs and thus also PRFs. In other words, a security loss that grows with the number of users is necessary for any such black-box reduction.</p>

<p>In EUROCRYPT ‚Äô96, Aiello and Venkatesan proposed two candidates for 2n-bit to 2n-bit pseudorandom functions (PRFs), called Benes and modified Benes (or mBenes), based on n-bit to n-bit PRFs. While Benes is known to be secure up to ( 2^n ) queries (Patarin, AFRICACRYPT ‚Äô08), the security of mBenes has only been proved up to ( 2^{n(1-\epsilon )} ) queries for all ( \epsilon &gt; 0 ) by Patarin and Montreuil in ICISC ‚Äô05. In this work, we show that the composition of a 2n-bit hash function with mBenes is a secure variable input length (VIL) PRF up to ( 2^{n-2} ) queries (given appropriate hash function bounds). We extend our analysis with block ciphers as the underlying primitive and obtain two optimally secure VIL PRFs using block ciphers. The first of these candidates requires 6 calls to the block cipher. The second candidate requires just 4 calls to the block cipher, but here the proof is based on Patarin‚Äôs mirror theory. Further, we instantiate the hash function with a PMAC+/LightMAC+ like hash, to get six candidates for deterministic message authentication codes with optimal security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Implementing cryptographic functions securely in the presence of physical adversaries is still a challenge although a lion‚Äôs share of research in the physical security domain has been put in development of countermeasures. Among several protection schemes, masking has absorbed the most attention of research in both academic and industrial communities, due to its theoretical foundation allowing to provide proofs or model the achieved security level. In return, masking schemes are difficult to implement as the implementation process often is manual, complex, and error-prone. This motivated the need for formal verification tools that allow the designers and engineers to analyze and verify the designs before manufacturing.</p>
<p>In this work, we present a new framework to analyze and verify masked implementations against various security notions using different security models as reference. In particular, our framework ‚Äì which directly processes the resulting gate-level netlist of a hardware synthesis ‚Äì particularly relies on Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs) and the concept of statistical independence of probability distributions. Compared to existing tools, our framework captivates due to its simplicity, accuracy, and functionality while still having a reasonable efficiency for many applications and common use-cases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A new approach to the security analysis of hardware-oriented masked ciphers against second-order side-channel attacks is developed. By relying on techniques from symmetric-key cryptanalysis, concrete security bounds are obtained in a variant of the probing model that allows the adversary to make only a bounded, but possibly very large, number of measurements. Specifically, it is formally shown how a bounded-query variant of robust probing security can be reduced to the linear cryptanalysis of masked ciphers. As a result, the compositional issues of higher-order threshold implementations can be overcome without relying on fresh randomness. From a practical point of view, the aforementioned approach makes it possible to transfer many of the desirable properties of first-order threshold implementations, such as their low randomness usage, to the second-order setting. For example, a straightforward application to the block cipher LED results in a masking using less than 700 random bits including the initial sharing. In addition, the cryptanalytic approach introduced in this paper provides additional insight into the design of masked ciphers and allows for a quantifiable trade-off between security and performance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Higher-order masking countermeasures provide strong provable security against side-channel attacks at the cost of incurring significant overheads, which largely hinders its applicability. Previous works towards remedying cost mostly concentrated on ‚Äúlocal‚Äù calculations, i.e., optimizing the cost of computation units such as a single AND gate or a field multiplication. This paper explores a complementary ‚Äúglobal‚Äù approach, i.e., considering multiple operations in the masked domain as a batch and reducing randomness and computational cost via amortization. In particular, we focus on the amortization of (\ell ) parallel field multiplications for appropriate integer (\ell &gt; 1), and design a kit named packed multiplication for implementing such a batch. For (\ell +d\le 2^m), when (\ell ) parallel multiplications over (\mathbb {F}_{2^{m}}) with d-th order probing security are implemented, packed multiplication consumes (d^2+2\ell d + \ell ) bilinear multiplications and (2d^2 + d(d+1)/2) random field variables, outperforming the state-of-the-art results with (O(\ell d^2)) multiplications and (\ell \left\lfloor d^2/4\right\rfloor + \ell d) randomness. To prove d-probing security for packed multiplications, we introduce some weaker security notions for multiple-inputs-multiple-outputs gadgets and use them as intermediate steps, which may be of independent interest. As parallel field multiplications exist almost everywhere in symmetric cryptography, lifting optimizations from ‚Äúlocal‚Äù to ‚Äúglobal‚Äù substantially enlarges the space of improvements. To demonstrate, we showcase the method on the AES Subbytes step, GCM and TET (a popular disk encryption). Notably, when (d=8), our implementation of AES Subbytes in ARM Cortex M architecture achieves a gain of up to (33\%) in total speeds and saves up to (68\%) random bits than the state-of-the-art bitsliced implementation reported at ASIACRYPT 2018.</p>

<p>This paper presents an attack based on side-channel information and (ISD) on the code-based Niederreiter cryptosystem and an evaluation of the practicality of the attack using an electromagnetic side channel. We start by directly adapting the timing side-channel plaintext-recovery attack by Shoufan et al. from 2010 to the constant-time implementation of the Niederreiter cryptosystem as used in the official FPGA-implementation of the NIST finalist ‚ÄúClassic McEliece‚Äù. We then enhance our attack using ISD and a new technique that we call iterative chunking to further significantly reduce the number of required side-channel measurements. We theoretically show that our attack improvements have a significant impact on reducing the number of required side-channel measurements. For example, for the 256-bit security parameter set kem/mceliece6960119 of ‚ÄúClassic McEliece‚Äù, we improve the basic attack that requires 5415 measurements to less than 562 measurements on average to mount a successful plaintext-recovery attack. Further reductions can be achieved at the price of increasing the cost of the ISD computations. We confirm our findings by practically mounting the attack on the official FPGA-implementation of ‚ÄúClassic McEliece‚Äù for all proposed parameter sets.</p>
