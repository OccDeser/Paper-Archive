### Abstract
> Non-committing encryption (NCE) introduced by Canetti et al. (STOC ’96) is a central tool to achieve multi-party computation protocols secure in the adaptive setting. Recently, Yoshida et al. (ASIACRYPT ’19) proposed an NCE scheme based on the hardness of the DDH problem, which has ciphertext expansion \(\mathcal {O}(\log \lambda )\) and public-key expansion \(\mathcal {O}(\lambda ^2)\).

### Abstract
> A traitor tracing scheme is a multi-user public-key encryption scheme where each user in the system holds a decryption key that is associated with the user’s identity. Using the public key, a content distributor can encrypt a message to all of the users in the system. At the same time, if a malicious group of users combine their respective decryption keys to build a “pirate decoder,” there is an efficient tracing algorithm that the content distributor can use to identify at least one of the keys used to construct the decoder. A trace-and-revoke scheme is an extension of a standard traitor tracing scheme where there is an additional key-revocation mechanism that the content distributor can use to disable the decryption capabilities of compromised keys. Namely, during encryption, the content distributor can encrypt a message with respect to a list of revoked users such that only non-revoked users can decrypt the resulting ciphertext.

### Abstract
> Motivated by the currently widespread concern about mass surveillance of encrypted communications, Bellare et al. introduced at CRYPTO 2014 the notion of Algorithm-Substitution Attack (ASA) where the legitimate encryption algorithm is replaced by a subverted one that aims to undetectably exfiltrate the secret key via ciphertexts. Practically implementable ASAs on various cryptographic primitives (Bellare et al., CRYPTO’14 & ACM CCS’15; Ateniese et al., ACM CCS’15; Berndt and Liśkiewicz, ACM CCS’17) have been constructed and analyzed, leaking the secret key successfully. Nevertheless, in spite of much progress, the practical impact of ASAs (formulated originally for symmetric key cryptography) on public-key (PKE) encryption operations remains unclear, primarily since the encryption operation of PKE does not involve the secret key, and also previously known ASAs become relatively inefficient for leaking the plaintext due to the logarithmic upper bound of exfiltration rate (Berndt and Liśkiewicz, ACM CCS’17).

### Abstract
> We propose the first tightly secure and unbounded hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) scheme based on standard assumptions. Our main technical contribution is a novel proof strategy that allows us to tightly randomize user secret keys for identities with arbitrary hierarchy depths using low entropy hidden in a small and hierarchy-independent master public key.

### Abstract
> Oblivious RAM enables oblivious access to memory in the single-client setting, which may not be the best fit in the network setting. Multi-client oblivious RAM (MCORAM) considers a collaborative but untrusted environment, where a database owner selectively grants read access and write access to different entries of a confidential database to multiple clients. Their access pattern must remain oblivious not only to the server but also to fellow clients. This upgrade rules out many techniques for constructing ORAM, forcing us to pursue new techniques. MCORAM not only provides an alternative solution to private anonymous data access (Eurocrypt 2019) but also serves as a promising building block for equipping oblivious file systems with access control and extending other advanced cryptosystems to the multi-client setting.

### Abstract
> Pattern matching is one of the most fundamental and important paradigms in several application domains such as digital forensics, cyber threat intelligence, or genomic and medical data analysis. While it is a straightforward operation when performed on plaintext data, it becomes a challenging task when the privacy of both the analyzed data and the analysis patterns must be preserved. In this paper, we propose new provably correct, secure, and relatively efficient (compared to similar existing schemes) public and private key based constructions that allow arbitrary pattern matching over encrypted data while protecting both the data to be analyzed and the patterns to be matched. That is, except the pattern provider (resp. the data owner), all other involved parties in the proposed constructions will learn nothing about the patterns to be searched (resp. the data to be inspected). Compared to existing solutions, the constructions we propose have some interesting properties: (1) the size of the ciphertext is linear to the size of plaintext and independent of the sizes and the number of the analysis patterns; (2) the sizes of the issued trapdoors are constant on the size of the data to be analyzed; and (3) the search complexity is linear on the size of the data to be inspected and is constant on the sizes of the analysis patterns. The conducted evaluations show that our constructions drastically improve the performance of the most efficient state of the art solution.

### Abstract
> Comparison of two numbers is one of the most frequently used operations, but it has been a challenging task to efficiently compute the comparison function in homomorphic encryption (HE) which basically supports addition and multiplication. Recently, Cheon et al. (Asiacrypt 2019) introduced a new approximate representation of the comparison function with a rational function, and showed that this rational function can be evaluated by an iterative algorithm. Due to this iterative feature, their method achieves a logarithmic computational complexity compared to previous polynomial approximation methods; however, the computational complexity is still not optimal, and the algorithm is quite slow for large-bit inputs in HE implementation.

### Abstract
> We prove that the module learning with errors (\(\mathrm {M\text {-}LWE}\)) problem with arbitrary polynomial-sized modulus p is classically at least as hard as standard worst-case lattice problems, as long as the module rank d is not smaller than the number field degree n. Previous publications only showed the hardness under quantum reductions. We achieve this result in an analogous manner as in the case of the learning with errors (\(\mathrm {LWE}\)) problem. First, we show the classical hardness of \(\mathrm {M\text {-}LWE}\) with an exponential-sized modulus. In a second step, we prove the hardness of \(\mathrm {M\text {-}LWE}\) using a binary secret. And finally, we provide a modulus reduction technique. The complete result applies to the class of power-of-two cyclotomic fields. However, several tools hold for more general classes of number fields and may be of independent interest.

### Abstract
> Electronic cash (e-cash) was introduced 40 years ago as the digital analogue of traditional cash. It allows users to withdraw electronic coins that can be spent anonymously with merchants. As advocated by Camenisch et al. (Eurocrypt 2005), it should be possible to store the withdrawn coins compactly (i.e., with logarithmic cost in the total number of coins), which has led to the notion of compact e-cash. Many solutions were proposed for this problem but the security proofs of most of them were invalidated by a very recent paper by Bourse et al. (Asiacrypt 2019). The same paper describes a generic way of fixing existing constructions/proofs but concrete instantiations of this patch are currently unknown in some settings. In particular, compact e-cash is no longer known to exist under quantum-safe assumptions. In this work, we resolve this problem by proposing the first secure compact e-cash system based on lattices following the result from Bourse et al. Contrarily to the latter work, our construction is not only generic, but we describe two concrete instantiations. We depart from previous frameworks of e-cash systems by leveraging lossy trapdoor functions to construct our coins. The indistinguishability of lossy and injective keys allows us to avoid the very strong requirements on the involved pseudo-random functions that were necessary to instantiate the generic patch proposed by Bourse et al.

### Abstract
> Approx-Svp is a well-known hard problem on lattices, which asks to find short vectors on a given lattice, but its variant restricted to ideal lattices (which correspond to ideals of the ring of integers \(\mathcal {O}_{K}\) of a number field K) is still not fully understood. For a long time, the best known algorithm to solve this problem on ideal lattices was the same as for arbitrary lattice. But recently, a series of works tends to show that solving this problem could be easier in ideal lattices than in arbitrary ones, in particular in the quantum setting.

### Abstract
> Isogeny-based assumptions have emerged as a viable option for quantum-secure cryptography. Recent works have shown how to build efficient (public-key) primitives from isogeny-based assumptions such as CSIDH and CSI-FiSh. However, in its present form, the landscape of isogenies does not seem very amenable to realizing new cryptographic applications. Isogeny-based assumptions often have unique efficiency and security properties, which makes building new cryptographic applications from them a potentially tedious and time-consuming task.

### Abstract
> This paper explores a new way of instantiating isogeny-based cryptography in which parties can work in both the \((p+1)\)-torsion of a set of supersingular curves and in the \((p-1)\)-torsion corresponding to the set of their quadratic twists. Although the isomorphism between a given supersingular curve and its quadratic twist is not defined over \(\mathbb {F}_{p^2}\) in general, restricting operations to the x-lines of both sets of twists allows all arithmetic to be carried out over \(\mathbb {F}_{p^2}\) as usual. Furthermore, since supersingular twists always have the same \(\mathbb {F}_{p^2}\)-rational j-invariant, the SIDH protocol remains unchanged when Alice and Bob are free to work in both sets of twists.

### Abstract
> We construct efficient ring signatures (RS) from isogeny and lattice assumptions. Our ring signatures are based on a logarithmic OR proof for group actions. We instantiate this group action by either the CSIDH group action or an MLWE-based group action to obtain our isogeny-based or lattice-based RS scheme, respectively. Even though the OR proof has a binary challenge space and therefore requires a number of repetitions which is linear in the security parameter, the sizes of our ring signatures are small and scale better with the ring size N than previously known post-quantum ring signatures. We also construct linkable ring signatures (LRS) that are almost as efficient as the non-linkable variants. The isogeny-based scheme produces signatures whose size is an order of magnitude smaller than all previously known logarithmic post-quantum ring signatures, but it is relatively slow (e.g. 5.5 KB signatures and 79 s signing time for rings with 8 members). In comparison, the lattice-based construction is much faster, but has larger signatures (e.g. 30 KB signatures and 90 ms signing time for the same ring size). For small ring sizes our lattice-based ring signatures are slightly larger than state-of-the-art schemes, but they are smaller for ring sizes larger than \(N \approx 1024\).

### Abstract
> This paper introduces a new approach to computing isogenies called “radical isogenies” and a corresponding method to compute chains of N-isogenies that is very efficient for small N. The method is fully deterministic and completely avoids generating N-torsion points. It is based on explicit formulae for the coordinates of an N-torsion point \(P'\) on the codomain of a cyclic N-isogeny \(\varphi : E \rightarrow E'\), such that composing \(\varphi \) with \(E' \rightarrow E' / \langle P' \rangle \) yields a cyclic \(N^2\)-isogeny. These formulae are simple algebraic expressions in the coefficients of E, the coordinates of a generator P of \(\ker \varphi \), and an Nth root \( \root N \of {\rho } \, \), where the radicand \(\rho \) itself is given by an easily computable algebraic expression in the coefficients of E and the coordinates of P. The formulae can be iterated and are particularly useful when computing chains of N-isogenies over a finite field \(\mathbb {F}_q\) with \(\gcd (q-1, N) = 1\), where taking an Nth root is a simple exponentiation. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our method results in an order of magnitude speed-up for \(N \le 13\); for larger N, the advantage disappears due to the increasing complexity of the formulae. When applied to CSIDH, we obtain a speed-up of about \(19 \%\) over the implementation by Bernstein, De Feo, Leroux and Smith for the CSURF-512 parameters.

### Abstract
> An oblivious PRF, or OPRF, is a protocol between a client and a server, where the server has a key k for a secure pseudorandom function F, and the client has an input x for the function. At the end of the protocol the client learns F(k, x), and nothing else, and the server learns nothing. An OPRF is verifiable if the client is convinced that the server has evaluated the PRF correctly with respect to a prior commitment to k. OPRFs and verifiable OPRFs have numerous applications, such as private-set-intersection protocols, password-based key-exchange protocols, and defense against denial-of-service attacks. Existing OPRF constructions use RSA-, Diffie-Hellman-, and lattice-type assumptions. The first two are not post-quantum secure.

### Abstract
> We propose two new supersingular isogeny-based public key encryptions: SiGamal and C-SiGamal. They were developed by giving an additional point of the order \(2^r\) to CSIDH. SiGamal is similar to ElGamal encryption, while C-SiGamal is a compressed version of SiGamal. We prove that SiGamal and C-SiGamal are IND-CPA secure without using hash functions under a new assumption: the P-CSSDDH assumption. This assumption comes from the expectation that no efficient algorithm can distinguish between a random point and a point that is the image of a public point under a hidden isogeny.

### Abstract
> Quantum variants of lattice sieve algorithms are routinely used to assess the security of lattice based cryptographic constructions. In this work we provide a heuristic, non-asymptotic, analysis of the cost of several algorithms for near neighbour search on high dimensional spheres. These algorithms are key components of lattice sieves. We design quantum circuits for near neighbour search algorithms and provide software that numerically optimises algorithm parameters according to various cost metrics. Using this software we estimate the cost of classical and quantum near neighbour search on spheres. For the most performant near neighbour search algorithm that we analyse we find a small quantum speedup in dimensions of cryptanalytic interest. Achieving this speedup requires several optimistic physical and algorithmic assumptions.

### Abstract
> Quantum pseudorandom functions (QPRFs) extend the classical security of a PRF by allowing the adversary to issue queries on input superpositions. Zhandry [Zhandry, FOCS 2012] showed a separation between the two notions and proved that common construction paradigms are also quantum secure, albeit with a new ad-hoc analysis. In this work we revisit the question of constructing QPRFs and propose a new method starting from small-domain (classical) PRFs: At the heart of our approach is a new domain-extension technique based on bipartite expanders. Interestingly, our analysis is almost entirely classical.

### Abstract
> We present new classical and quantum algorithms for solving random subset-sum instances. First, we improve over the Becker-Coron-Joux algorithm (EUROCRYPT 2011) from \( \widetilde{\mathcal {O}} \left( 2^{0.291 n} \right) \) down to \( \widetilde{\mathcal {O}} \left( 2^{0.283 n} \right) \), using more general representations with values in \(\{-1,0,1,2\}\). Next, we improve the state of the art of quantum algorithms for this problem in several directions. By combining the Howgrave-Graham-Joux algorithm (EUROCRYPT 2010) and quantum search, we devise an algorithm with asymptotic running time \( \widetilde{\mathcal {O}} \left( 2^{0.236 n} \right) \), lower than the cost of the quantum walk based on the same classical algorithm proposed by Bernstein, Jeffery, Lange and Meurer (PQCRYPTO 2013). This algorithm has the advantage of using classical memory with quantum random access, while the previously known algorithms used the quantum walk framework, and required quantum memory with quantum random access.

### Abstract
> Secure delegated quantum computing allows a computationally weak client to outsource an arbitrary quantum computation to an untrusted quantum server in a privacy-preserving manner. One of the promising candidates to achieve classical delegation of quantum computation is classical-client remote state preparation (\(\mathsf{RSP}_{\mathsf{CC}}\)), where a client remotely prepares a quantum state using a classical channel. However, the privacy loss incurred by employing \(\mathsf{RSP}_{\mathsf{CC}}\) as a sub-module is unclear. In this work, we investigate this question using the Constructive Cryptography framework by Maurer and Renner
[MR11]. We first identify the goal of \(\mathsf{RSP}_{\mathsf{CC}}\) as the construction of ideal \(\mathsf{RSP}\) resources from classical channels and then reveal the security limitations of using \(\mathsf{RSP}_{\mathsf{CC}}\). First, we uncover a fundamental relationship between constructing ideal \(\mathsf{RSP}\) resources (from classical channels) and the task of cloning quantum states. Any classically constructed ideal \(\mathsf{RSP}\) resource must leak to the server the full classical description (possibly in an encoded form) of the generated quantum state, even if we target computational security only. As a consequence, we find that the realization of common \(\mathsf{RSP}\) resources, without weakening their guarantees drastically, is impossible due to the no-cloning theorem. Second, the above result does not rule out that a specific \(\mathsf{RSP}_{\mathsf{CC}}\) protocol can replace the quantum channel at least in some contexts, such as the Universal Blind Quantum Computing (\(\mathsf{UBQC}\)) protocol of Broadbent et al.
[BFK09]. However, we show that the resulting UBQC protocol cannot maintain its proven composable security as soon as \(\mathsf{RSP}_{\mathsf{CC}}\) is used as a subroutine. Third, we show that replacing the quantum channel of the above \(\mathsf{UBQC}\) protocol by the \(\mathsf{RSP}_{\mathsf{CC}}\) protocol QFactory of Cojocaru et al.
[CCKW19] preserves the weaker, game-based, security of \(\mathsf{UBQC}\).

### Abstract
> We propose some quantum circuit implementations of AES with the following improvements. Firstly, we propose some quantum circuits of the AES S-box and S-box\(^{-1}\), which require fewer qubits than prior work. Secondly, we reduce the number of qubits in the zig-zag method by introducing the S-box\(^{-1}\) operation in our quantum circuits of AES. Thirdly, we present a method to reduce the number of qubits in the key schedule of AES. While the previous quantum circuits of AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 need at least 864, 896, and 1232 qubits respectively, our quantum circuit implementations of AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 only require 512, 640, and 768 qubits respectively, where the number of qubits is reduced by more than 30%.

### Abstract
> At EUROCRYPT 2020, Hosoyamada and Sasaki proposed the first dedicated quantum attack on hash functions—a quantum version of the rebound attack exploiting differentials whose probabilities are too low to be useful in the classical setting. This work opens up a new perspective toward the security of hash functions against quantum attacks. In particular, it tells us that the search for differentials should not stop at the classical birthday bound. Despite these interesting and promising implications, the concrete attacks described by Hosoyamada and Sasaki make use of large quantum random access memories (qRAMs), a resource whose availability in the foreseeable future is controversial even in the quantum computation community. Without large qRAMs, these attacks incur significant increases in time complexities. In this work, we reduce or even avoid the use of qRAMs by performing a quantum rebound attack based on differentials with non-full-active super S-boxes. Along the way, an MILP-based method is proposed to systematically explore the search space of useful truncated differentials with respect to rebound attacks. As a result, we obtain improved attacks on AES-MMO, AES-MP, and the first classical collision attacks on 4- and 5-round Grøstl-512. Interestingly, the use of non-full-active super S-box differentials in the analysis of AES-MMO gives rise to new difficulties in collecting enough starting points. To overcome this issue, we consider attacks involving two message blocks to gain more degrees of freedom, and we successfully compress the qRAM demand of the collision attacks on AES-MMO and AES-MP (EUROCRYPT 2020) from \(2^{48}\) to a range from \(2^{16}\) to 0, while still maintaining a comparable time complexity. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first dedicated quantum attacks on hash functions that slightly outperform Chailloux, Naya-Plasencia, and Schrottenloher’s generic quantum collision attack (ASIACRYPT 2017) in a model where large qRAMs are not available. This work demonstrates again how a clever combination of classical cryptanalytic technique and quantum computation leads to improved attacks, and shows that the direction pointed out by Hosoyamada and Sasaki deserves further investigation.

### Abstract
> We propose a generic construction of 2-pass authenticated key exchange (AKE) scheme with explicit authentication from key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) and signature (SIG) schemes. We improve the security model due to Gjøsteen and Jager [Crypto2018] to a stronger one. In the strong model, if a replayed message is accepted by some user, the authentication of AKE is broken. We define a new security notion named “IND-mCPA with adaptive reveals” for KEM. When the underlying KEM has such a security and SIG has unforgeability with adaptive corruptions, our construction of AKE equipped with counters as states is secure in the strong model, and stateless AKE without counter is secure in the traditional model. We also present a KEM possessing tight “IND-mCPA security with adaptive reveals” from the Computation Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model. When the generic construction of AKE is instantiated with the KEM and the available SIG by Gjøsteen and Jager [Crypto2018], we obtain the first practical 2-pass AKE with tight security and explicit authentication. In addition, the integration of the tightly IND-mCCA secure KEM (derived from PKE by Han et al. [Crypto2019]) and the tightly secure SIG by Bader et al. [TCC2015] results in the first tightly secure 2-pass AKE with explicit authentication in the standard model.
