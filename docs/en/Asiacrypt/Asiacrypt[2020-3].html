<blockquote>
<p>MPC functionalities are increasingly specified in high-level languages, where control-flow constructions such as conditional statements are extensively used. Today, concretely efficient MPC protocols are circuit-based and must evaluate all conditional branches at high cost to hide the taken branch.</p>
<p>The Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson, or GMW, protocol is a foundational circuit-based technique that realizes MPC for p players and is secure against up to (p-1) semi-honest corruptions. While GMW requires communication rounds proportional to the computed circuit‚Äôs depth, it is effective in many natural settings.</p>
<p>Our main contribution is (\mathtt {MOTIF}) (Minimizing OTs for IFs), a novel GMW extension that evaluates conditional branches almost for free by amortizing Oblivious Transfers (OTs) across branches. That is, we simultaneously evaluate multiple independent (\mathtt {AND}) gates, one gate from each mutually exclusive branch, by representing them as a single cheap vector-scalar multiplication ((\mathtt {VS})) gate.</p>
<p>For 2PC with b branches, we simultaneously evaluate up to b (\mathtt {AND}) gates using only two 1-out-of-2 OTs of b-bit secrets. This is a factor (\approx b) improvement over the state-of-the-art 2b 1-out-of-2 OTs of 1-bit secrets. Our factor b improvement generalizes to the multiparty setting as well: b (\mathtt {AND}) gates consume only (p(p-1)) 1-out-of-2 OTs of b-bit secrets.</p>
<p>We implemented our approach and report its performance. For 2PC and a circuit with 16 branches, each comparing two length-65000 bitstrings, (\mathtt {MOTIF}) outperforms standard GMW in terms of communication by (\approx )9.4(\times ). Total wall-clock time is improved by (4.1 - 9.2) (\times ) depending on network settings.</p>
<p>Our work is in the semi-honest model, tolerating all-but-one corruptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Computing on data in a manner that preserve the privacy is of growing importance. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) are two cryptographic techniques for privacy-preserving computations. In this work, we have developed efficient UC-secure multiparty protocols for matrix multiplications and two-dimensional convolutions. We built upon the SPDZ framework and integrated the state-of-the-art HE algorithms for matrix multiplication. Our protocol achieved communication cost linear only in the input and output dimensions and not on the number of multiplication operations. We eliminate the ‚Äútriple sacrifice‚Äù step of SPDZ to improve efficiency and simplify the zero-knowledge proofs. We implemented our protocols and benchmarked them against the SPDZ LowGear variant (Keller et al. Eurocrypt‚Äô18). For multiplying two square matrices of size 128, we reduced the communication cost from 1.54 GB to 12.46 MB, an improvement of over two orders of magnitude that only improves with larger matrix sizes. For evaluating all convolution layers of the ResNet-50 neural network, the communication reduces cost from 5 TB to 41 GB.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The two traditional streams of multiparty computation (MPC) protocols consist of‚Äì (a) protocols achieving guaranteed output delivery ((\textsf {god})) or fairness ((\textsf {fn})) in the honest-majority setting and (b) protocols achieving unanimous or selective abort ((\textsf {ua}), (\textsf {sa})) in the dishonest-majority setting. The favorable presence of honest majority amongst the participants is necessary to achieve the stronger notions of (\textsf {god}) or (\textsf {fn}). While the constructions of each type are abound in the literature, one class of protocols does not seem to withstand the threat model of the other. For instance, the honest-majority protocols do not guarantee privacy of the inputs of the honest parties in the face of dishonest majority and likewise the dishonest-majority protocols cannot achieve (\textsf {god}) and (\textsf {fn}), tolerating even a single corruption, let alone dishonest minority. The promise of the unconventional yet much sought-after species of MPC, termed as ‚ÄòBest-of-Both-Worlds‚Äô (BoBW), is to offer the best possible security depending on the actual corruption scenario.</p>
<p>This work nearly settles the exact round complexity of two classes of BoBW protocols differing on the security achieved in the honest-majority setting, namely (\textsf {god}) and (\textsf {fn}) respectively, under the assumption of no setup (plain model), public setup (CRS) and private setup (CRS + PKI or simply PKI). The former class necessarily requires the number of parties to be strictly more than the sum of the bounds of corruptions in the honest-majority and dishonest-majority setting, for a feasible solution to exist. Demoting the goal to the second-best attainable security in the honest-majority setting, the latter class needs no such restriction.</p>
<p>Assuming a network with pair-wise private channels and a broadcast channel, we show that 5 and 3 rounds are necessary and sufficient for the class of BoBW MPC with (\textsf {fn}) under the assumption of ‚Äòno setup‚Äô and ‚Äòpublic and private setup‚Äô respectively. For the class of BoBW MPC with (\textsf {god}), we show necessity and sufficiency of 3 rounds for the public setup case and 2 rounds for the private setup case. In the no setup setting, we show the sufficiency of 5 rounds, while the known lower bound is 4. All our upper bounds are based on polynomial-time assumptions and assume black-box simulation. With distinct feasibility conditions, the classes differ in terms of the round requirement. The bounds are in some cases different and on a positive note at most one more, compared to the maximum of the needs of the honest-majority and dishonest-majority setting. Our results remain unaffected when security with abort and fairness are upgraded to their identifiable counterparts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two paradigms for secure MPC are synchronous and asynchronous protocols. While synchronous protocols tolerate more corruptions and allow every party to give its input, they are very slow because the speed depends on the conservatively assumed worst-case delay (\varDelta ) of the network. In contrast, asynchronous protocols allow parties to obtain output as fast as the actual network allows, a property called responsiveness, but unavoidably have lower resilience and parties with slow network connections cannot give input.</p>
<p>It is natural to wonder whether it is possible to leverage synchronous MPC protocols to achieve responsiveness, hence obtaining the advantages of both paradigms: full security with responsiveness up to t corruptions, and extended security (full security or security with unanimous abort) with no responsiveness up to (T \ge t) corruptions. We settle the question by providing matching feasibility and impossibility results:</p>
<p>For the case of unanimous abort as extended security, there is an MPC protocol if and only if (T + 2t &lt; n).</p>
<p>For the case of full security as extended security, there is an MPC protocol if and only if (T &lt; \frac{n}{2}) and (T + 2t &lt; n). In particular, setting (t = \frac{n}{4}) allows to achieve a fully secure MPC for honest majority, which in addition benefits from having substantial responsiveness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Motivated by what we call ‚Äúhonest but lazy‚Äù parties in the context of secure multi party computation, we revisit the notion of multi-key FHE schemes (MFHE). In MFHE, any message encrypted using a public key (pk_i) can be ‚Äúexpanded‚Äù so that the resulting ciphertext is encrypted with respect to a set of public keys ((pk_1,..,pk_n)). Such expanded ciphertexts can be homomorphically evaluated with respect to any circuit to generate a ciphertext (ct). Then, this ciphertext (ct) can be partially decrypted using a secret key (sk_i) (corresponding to the public key (pk_i)) to produce a partial decryption (p_i). Finally, these partial decryptions ({p_{i}}_{i\in [n]}) can be combined to recover the output. However, this definition of MFHE works only for n-out-of-n access structures and, thus, each node in the system is a point of failure. In the context of ‚Äúhonest but lazy‚Äù parties, it is necessary to be able to decrypt even when only given a subset of partial decryptions (say t out of n). In order to solve this problem, we introduce a new notion of multi-key FHE designed to handle arbitrary access patterns that can reconstruct the output. We call it a threshold multi-key FHE scheme (TMFHE).</p>
<p>Our main contributions are the following:</p>
<p>We formally define and construct TMFHE for any access structure given by a monotone boolean formula, assuming LWE.</p>
<p>We construct the first simulation-extractable multi-string NIZK from polynomially hard LWE.</p>
<p>We use TMFHE and our multi-string NIZK to obtain the first round-optimal (three round) MPC protocol in the plain model with guaranteed output delivery secure against malicious adversaries or, more generally, mixed adversaries (which supports ‚Äúhonest but lazy‚Äù parties), assuming LWE.</p>
<p>Our MPC protocols simultaneously achieve security against the maximum number of corruptions under which guaranteed output delivery is achievable, depth-proportional communication complexity, and reusability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We study information-theoretic multiparty computation (MPC) protocols over rings (\mathbb {Z}/p^k\mathbb {Z} ) that have good asymptotic communication complexity for a large number of players. An important ingredient for such protocols is arithmetic secret sharing, i.e., linear secret-sharing schemes with multiplicative properties. The standard way to obtain these over fields is with a family of linear codes C, such that C, (C^\perp ) and (C^2) are asymptotically good (strongly multiplicative). For our purposes here it suffices if the square code (C^2) is not the whole space, i.e., has codimension at least 1 (multiplicative).</p>
<p>Our approach is to lift such a family of codes defined over a finite field (\mathbb {F}) to a Galois ring, which is a local ring that has (\mathbb {F}) as its residue field and that contains (\mathbb {Z}/p^k\mathbb {Z} ) as a subring, and thus enables arithmetic that is compatible with both structures. Although arbitrary lifts preserve the distance and dual distance of a code, as we demonstrate with a counterexample, the multiplicative property is not preserved. We work around this issue by showing a dedicated lift that preserves self-orthogonality (as well as distance and dual distance), for (p \ge 3). Self-orthogonal codes are multiplicative, therefore we can use existing results of asymptotically good self-dual codes over fields to obtain arithmetic secret sharing over Galois rings. For (p = 2) we obtain multiplicativity by using existing techniques of secret-sharing using both C and (C^\perp ), incurring a constant overhead. As a result, we obtain asymptotically good arithmetic secret-sharing schemes over Galois rings.</p>
<p>With these schemes in hand, we extend existing field-based MPC protocols to obtain MPC over (\mathbb {Z}/p^k\mathbb {Z} ), in the setting of a submaximal adversary corrupting less than a fraction (1/2 - \varepsilon ) of the players, where (\varepsilon &gt; 0) is arbitrarily small. We consider 3 different corruption models. For passive and active security with abort, our protocols communicate O(n) bits per multiplication. For full security with guaranteed output delivery we use a preprocessing model and get O(n) bits per multiplication in the online phase and (O(n \log n)) bits per multiplication in the offline phase. Thus, we obtain true linear bit complexities, without the common assumption that the ring size depends on the number of players.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reducing the rounds of interaction in secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols has been the topic of study of many works. One popular approach to reduce rounds is to construct round compression compilers. A round compression compiler is one that takes a highly interactive protocol and transforms it into a protocol with far fewer rounds. The design of round compression compilers has traditionally focused on preserving the security properties of the underlying protocol and in particular, not much attention has been given towards preserving their computational and communication efficiency. Indeed, the recent round compression compilers that yield round-optimal MPC protocols incur large computational and communication overhead.</p>
<p>In this work, we initiate the study of efficiency-preserving round compression compilers, i.e. compilers that translate the efficiency benefits of the underlying highly interactive protocols to the fewer round setting. Focusing on the honest majority setting (with near-optimal corruption threshold (\frac{1}{2} - \varepsilon ), for any (\varepsilon &gt; 0)), we devise a new compiler that yields two round (i.e., round optimal) semi-honest MPC with similar communication efficiency as the underlying (arbitrary round) protocol. By applying our compiler on the most efficient known MPC protocols, we obtain a two-round semi-honest protocol based on one-way functions, with total communication (and per-party computation) cost (\widetilde{O}(s+n^4)) ‚Äì a significant improvement over prior two-round protocols with cost (\widetilde{O}(n^\tau s+n^{\tau +1}d)), where (\tau \ge 2), s is the size of the circuit computing the function and d the corresponding depth. Our result can also be extended to handle malicious adversaries, either using stronger assumptions in the public key infrastructure (PKI) model, or in the plain model using an extra round.</p>
<p>An artifact of our approach is that the resultant protocol is ‚Äúunbalanced‚Äù in the amount of computation performed by different parties. We give evidence that this is necessary in our setting. Our impossibility result makes novel use of the ‚ÄúMPC-in-the-head" paradigm which has typically been used to demonstrate feasibility results.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At CRYPTO 2018, Cascudo et al. introduced Reverse Multiplication Friendly Embeddings (RMFEs). These are a mechanism to compute (\delta ) parallel evaluations of the same arithmetic circuit over a field (\mathbb {F}<em>q) at the cost of a single evaluation of that circuit in (\mathbb {F}</em>{q^d}), where (\delta &lt; d). Due to this inequality, RMFEs are a useful tool when protocols require to work over (\mathbb {F}<em>{q^d}) but one is only interested in computing over (\mathbb {F}_q). In this work we introduce Circuit Amortization Friendly Encodings (CAFEs), which generalize RMFEs while having concrete efficiency in mind. For a Galois Ring (R = GR(2^{k},d)), CAFEs allow to compute certain circuits over (\mathbb {Z}</em>{2^k}) at the cost of a single secure multiplication in R. We present three CAFE instantiations, which we apply to the protocol for MPC over (\mathbb {Z}<em>{2^k}) via Galois Rings by Abspoel et al. (TCC 2019). Our protocols allow for efficient switching between the different CAFEs, as well as between computation over (GR(2^{k},d)) and (\mathbb {F}</em>{2^{d}}) in a way that preserves the CAFE in both rings. This adaptability leads to efficiency gains for e.g. Machine Learning applications, which can be represented as highly parallel circuits over (\mathbb {Z}_{2^k}) followed by bit-wise operations. From an implementation of our techniques, we estimate that an SVM can be evaluated on 250 images in parallel up to (\times 7) more efficiently using our techniques, compared to the protocol from Abspoel et al. (TCC 2019).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secure computation protocols enable mutually distrusting parties to compute a function of their private inputs while revealing nothing but the output. Protocols with full security (also known as guaranteed output delivery) in particular protect against denial-of-service attacks, guaranteeing that honest parties receive a correct output. This feature can be realized in the presence of an honest majority, and significant research effort has gone toward attaining full security with good asymptotic and concrete efficiency.</p>
<p>We present an efficient protocol for any constant number of parties n, with full security against ({t&lt;n/2}) corrupted parties, that makes a black-box use of a pseudorandom generator. Our protocol evaluates an arithmetic circuit C over a finite ring R (either a finite field or ({{R={\mathbb {Z}}_{2^k}}})) with communication complexity of ({{\frac{3t}{2t+1}S + o(S)}}) R-elements per party, where S is the number of multiplication gates in C (namely, ({&lt;1.5}) elements per party per gate). This matches the best known protocols for the semi-honest model up to the sublinear additive term. For a small number of parties n, this improves over a recent protocol of Goyal et al. (Crypto 2020) by a constant factor for circuits over large fields, and by at least an ({{\varOmega (\log n)}}) factor for Boolean circuits or circuits over rings.</p>
<p>Our protocol provides new methods for applying the distributed zero-knowledge proofs of Boneh et al. (Crypto 2019), which only require logarithmic communication, for compiling semi-honest protocols into fully secure ones in the more challenging case of (t&gt;1) corrupted parties. Our protocol relies on replicated secret sharing to minimize communication and simplify the mechanism for achieving full security. This results in computational cost that scales exponentially with n.</p>
<p>Our main protocol builds on a new honest-majority protocol for verifying the correctness of multiplication triples by making a general use of distributed zero-knowledge proofs. While the protocol only achieves the weaker notion of security with abort, it applies to any linear secret-sharing scheme and provides a conceptually simpler, more general, and more efficient alternative to previous protocols from the literature. In particular, it can be combined with the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to simultaneously achieve logarithmic communication complexity and constant round complexity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We construct the most efficient two-round adaptively secure bit-OT in the Common Random String ((\text {CRS} )) model. The scheme is UC secure under the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption. It incurs (\mathcal {O}(1)) exponentiations and sends (\mathcal {O}(1)) group elements, whereas the state of the art requires (\mathcal {O}(\kappa ^2)) exponentiations and communicates (\text {poly}(\kappa )) bits, where (\kappa ) is the computational security parameter. Along the way, we obtain several other efficient UC-secure OT protocols under DDH:</p>
<p>The most efficient yet two-round adaptive string-OT protocol assuming global programmable random oracle. Furthermore, the protocol can be made non-interactive in the simultaneous message setting, assuming random inputs for the sender.</p>
<p>The first two-round string-OT with amortized constant exponentiations and communication overhead which is secure in the global observable random oracle model.</p>
<p>The first two-round receiver equivocal string-OT in the (\text {CRS} ) model that incurs constant computation and communication overhead.</p>
<p>We also obtain the first non-interactive adaptive string UC-commitment in the CRS model which incurs a sublinear communication overhead in the security parameter. Specifically, we commit to (\text {polylog}(\kappa )) bits while communicating (\mathcal {O}(\kappa )) bits. Moreover, it is additively homomorphic.</p>
<p>We can also extend our results to the single (\text {CRS} ) model where multiple sessions share the same (\text {CRS} ). As a corollary, we obtain a two-round adaptively secure MPC protocol in this model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this paper we present ALBATROSS, a family of multiparty randomness generation protocols with guaranteed output delivery and public verification that allows to trade off corruption tolerance for a much improved amortized computational complexity. Our basic stand alone protocol is based on publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) and is secure under in the random oracle model under the decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) hardness assumption. We also address the important issue of constructing Universally Composable randomness beacons, showing two UC versions of Albatross: one based on simple UC NIZKs and another one based on novel efficient ‚Äúdesignated verifier‚Äù homomorphic commitments. Interestingly this latter version can be instantiated from a global random oracle under the weaker Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption. An execution of ALBATROSS with n parties, out of which up to (t=(1/2-\epsilon )\cdot n) are corrupt for a constant (\epsilon &gt;0), generates (\varTheta (n^2)) uniformly random values, requiring in the worst case an amortized cost per party of (\varTheta (\log n)) exponentiations per random value. We significantly improve on the SCRAPE protocol (Cascudo and David, ACNS 17), which required (\varTheta (n^2)) exponentiations per party to generate one uniformly random value. This is mainly achieved via two techniques: first, the use of packed Shamir secret sharing for the PVSS; second, the use of linear t-resilient functions (computed via a Fast Fourier Transform-based algorithm) to improve the randomness extraction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Generating additive secret shares of a shuffled dataset - such that neither party knows the order in which it is permuted - is a fundamental building block in many protocols, such as secure collaborative filtering, oblivious sorting, and secure function evaluation on set intersection. Traditional approaches to this problem either involve expensive public-key based crypto or using symmetric crypto on permutation networks. While public-key-based solutions are bandwidth efficient, they are computation-heavy. On the other hand, constructions based on permutation networks are communication-bound, especially when the dataset contains large elements, for e.g., feature vectors in an ML context.</p>
<p>We design a new 2-party protocol for this task of computing secret shares of shuffled data, which we refer to as secret-shared shuffle. Our protocol is secure against a static semi-honest adversary. At the heart of our approach is a new primitive we define (which we call ‚ÄúShare Translation‚Äù) that generates two sets of pseudorandom values ‚Äúcorrelated via the permutation‚Äù. This allows us to reduce the problem of shuffling the dataset to the problem of shuffling pseudorandom values, which enables optimizations both in computation and communication. We then design a Share Translation protocol based on oblivious transfer and puncturable PRFs.</p>
<p>Our final protocol for secret-shared shuffle uses lightweight operations like XOR and PRGs, and in particular doesn‚Äôt use public-key operations besides the base OTs. As a result, our protocol is concretely more efficient than the existing solutions. In particular, we are two-three orders of magnitude faster than public-key-based approach and one order of magnitude faster compared to the best known symmetric-key approach when the elements are moderately large.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is an advanced form of encryption scheme allowing for access policies to be embedded within the secret keys and ciphertexts. By now, we have ABEs supporting numerous types of policies based on hardness assumptions over bilinear maps and lattices. However, one of the distinguishing differences between ABEs based on these two breeds of assumptions is that the former can achieve adaptive security for quite expressible policies (e.g., inner-products, boolean formula) while the latter can not. Recently, two adaptively secure lattice-based ABEs have appeared and changed the state of affairs: a non-zero inner-product (NIPE) encryption by Katsumata and Yamada (PKC‚Äô19) and an ABE for t-CNF policies by Tsabary (CRYPTO‚Äô19). However, the policies supported by these ABEs are still quite limited and do not embrace the more interesting policies that have been studied in the literature. Notably, constructing an adaptively secure inner-product encryption (IPE) based on lattices still remains open.</p>
<p>In this work, we propose the first adaptively secure IPE based on the learning with errors (LWE) assumption with sub-exponential modulus size (without resorting to complexity leveraging). Concretely, our IPE supports inner-products over the integers (\mathbb {Z}) with polynomial sized entries and satisfies adaptively weakly-attribute-hiding security. We also show how to convert such an IPE to an IPE supporting inner-products over (\mathbb {Z}_p) for a polynomial-sized p and a fuzzy identity-based encryption (FIBE) for small and large universes. Our result builds on the ideas presented in Tsabary (CRYPTO‚Äô19), which uses constrained pseudorandom functions (CPRF) in a semi-generic way to achieve adaptively secure ABEs, and the recent lattice-based adaptively secure CPRF for inner-products by Davidson et al. (CRYPTO‚Äô20). Our main observation is realizing how to weaken the conforming CPRF property introduced in Tsabary (CRYPTO‚Äô19) by taking advantage of the specific linearity property enjoyed by the lattice evaluation algorithms by Boneh et al. (EUROCRYPT‚Äô14).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At Eurocrypt‚Äô19, Attrapadung presented several transformations that dynamically compose a set of attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes for simpler predicates into a new ABE scheme for more expressive predicates. Due to the powerful unbounded and modular nature of his compositions, many new ABE schemes can be obtained in a systematic manner. However, his approach heavily relies on q-type assumptions, which are not standard. Devising such powerful compositions from standard assumptions was left as an important open problem. In this paper, we present a new framework for constructing ABE schemes that allow unbounded and dynamic predicate compositions among them, and show that the adaptive security of these composed ABE will be preserved by relying only on the standard matrix Diffie-Hellman (MDDH) assumption. This thus resolves the open problem posed by Attrapadung. As for applications, we obtain various ABEs that are the first such instantiations of their kinds from standard assumptions. These include the following adaptively secure large-universe ABEs for Boolean formulae under MDDH:</p>
<p>The first completely unbounded monotone key-policy (KP)/ciphertext-policy (CP) ABE. Such ABE was recently proposed, but only for the KP and small-universe flavor (Kowalczyk and Wee, Eurocrypt‚Äô19).</p>
<p>The first completely unbounded non-monotone KP/CP-ABE. Especially, our ABEs support a new type of non-monotonicity that subsumes previous two types of non-monotonicity, namely, by Ostrovsky et al. (CCS‚Äô07) and by Okamoto and Takashima (CRYPTO‚Äô10).</p>
<p>The first (non-monotone) KP and CP-ABE with constant-size ciphertexts and secret keys, respectively.</p>
<p>The first KP and CP-ABE with constant-size secret keys and ciphertexts, respectively.</p>
<p>At the core of our framework lies a new partially symmetric design of the core 1-key 1-ciphertext oracle component called Key Encoding Indistinguishability, which exploits the symmetry so as to obtain compositions.</p>

<p>We present succinct and adaptively secure attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes for arithmetic branching programs, based on k-Lin in pairing groups. Our key-policy ABE scheme has ciphertexts of constant size, independent of the length of the attributes, and our ciphertext-policy ABE scheme has secret keys of constant size. Our schemes improve upon the recent succinct ABE schemes in [Tomida and Attrapadung, ePrint ‚Äô20], which only handles Boolean formulae. All other prior succinct ABE schemes either achieve only selective security or rely on q-type assumptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We construct new functional encryption schemes that combine the access control functionality of attribute-based encryption with the possibility of performing linear operations on the encrypted data. While such a primitive could be easily realized from fully fledged functional encryption schemes, what makes our result interesting is the fact that our schemes simultaneously achieve all the following properties. They are public-key, efficient and can be proved secure under standard and well established assumptions (such as LWE or pairings). Furthermore, security is guaranteed in the setting where adversaries are allowed to get functional keys that decrypt the challenge ciphertext. Our first results are two functional encryption schemes for the family of functions that allow users to embed policies (expressed by monotone span programs) in the encrypted data, so that one can generate functional keys to compute weighted sums on the latter. Both schemes are pairing-based and quite generic: they combine the ALS functional encryption scheme for inner products from Crypto 2016 with any attribute-based encryption schemes relying on the dual-system encryption methodology. As an additional bonus, they yield simple and elegant multi-input extensions essentially for free, thereby broadening the set of applications for such schemes. Multi-input is a particularly desirable feature in our setting, since it gives a finer access control over the encrypted data, by allowing users to associate different access policies to different parts of the encrypted data. Our second result builds identity-based functional encryption for inner products from lattices. This is achieved by carefully combining existing IBE schemes from lattices with adapted, LWE-based, variants of ALS. We point out to intrinsic technical bottlenecks to obtain richer forms of access control from lattices. From a conceptual point of view, all our results can be seen as further evidence that more expressive forms of functional encryption can be realized under standard assumptions and with little computational overhead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Modern attribute-based anonymous credential (ABC) systems benefit from special encodings that yield expressive and highly efficient show proofs on logical statements. The technique was first proposed by Camenisch and Gro√ü, who constructed an SRSA-based ABC system with prime-encoded attributes that offers efficient AND, OR and NOT proofs. While other ABC frameworks have adopted constructions in the same vein, the Camenisch-Gro√ü ABC has been the most expressive and asymptotically most efficient proof system to date, even if it was constrained by the requirement of a trusted message-space setup and an inherent restriction to finite-set attributes encoded as primes. In this paper, combining a new set commitment scheme and an SDH-based signature scheme, we present a provably secure ABC system that supports show proofs for complex statements. This construction is not only more expressive than existing approaches, but it is also highly efficient under unrestricted attribute space due to its ECC protocols only requiring a constant number of bilinear pairings by the verifier; none by the prover. Furthermore, we introduce strong security models for impersonation and unlinkability under adaptive active and concurrent attacks to allow for the expressiveness of our ABC as well as for a systematic comparison to existing schemes. Given this foundation, we are the first to comprehensively formally prove the security of an ABC with expressive show proofs. Specifically, building upon the q-(co-)SDH assumption, we prove the security against impersonation with a tight reduction. Besides the set commitment scheme, which may be of independent interest, our security models can serve as a foundation for the design of future ABC systems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Periodic key rotation is a common practice designed to limit the long-term power of cryptographic keys. Key rotation refers to the process of re-encrypting encrypted content under a fresh key, and overwriting the old ciphertext with the new one. When encrypted data is stored in the cloud, key rotation can be very costly: it may require downloading the entire encrypted content from the cloud, re-encrypting it on the client‚Äôs machine, and uploading the new ciphertext back to the cloud.</p>
<p>An updatable encryption scheme is a symmetric-key encryption scheme designed to support efficient key rotation in the cloud. The data owner sends a short update token to the cloud. This update token lets the cloud rotate the ciphertext from the old key to the new key, without learning any information about the plaintext. Recent work on updatable encryption has led to several security definitions and proposed constructions. However, existing constructions are not yet efficient enough for practical adoption, and the existing security definitions can be strengthened.</p>
<p>In this work we make three contributions. First, we introduce stronger security definitions for updatable encryption (in the ciphertext-dependent setting) that capture desirable security properties not covered in prior work. Second, we construct two new updatable encryption schemes. The first construction relies only on symmetric cryptographic primitives, but only supports a bounded number of key rotations. The second construction supports a (nearly) unbounded number of updates, and is built from the Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) assumption. Due to complexities of using RLWE, this scheme achieves a slightly weaker notion of integrity compared to the first. Finally, we implement both constructions and compare their performance to prior work. Our RLWE-based construction is 200(\times ) faster than a prior proposal for an updatable encryption scheme based on the hardness of elliptic curve DDH. Our first construction, based entirely on symmetric primitives, has the highest encryption throughput, approaching the performance of AES, and the highest decryption throughput on ciphertexts that were re-encrypted fewer than fifty times. For ciphertexts re-encrypted over fifty times, the RLWE construction dominates it in decryption speed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Updatable encryption (UE) is an attractive primitive, which allows the secret key of the outsourced encrypted data to be updated to a fresh one periodically. Several elegant works exist studying various security properties. We notice several major issues in existing security models of (ciphertext dependent) updatable encryption, in particular, integrity and CCA security. The adversary in the models is only allowed to request the server to re-encrypt honestly generated ciphertext, while in practice, an attacker could try to inject arbitrary ciphertexts into the server as she wishes. Those malformed ciphertext could be updated and leveraged by the adversary and cause serious security issues.</p>
<p>In this paper, we fill the gap and strengthen the security definitions in multiple aspects: most importantly our integrity and CCA security models remove the restriction in previous models and achieve standard notions of integrity and CCA security in the setting of updatable encryption. Along the way, we refine the security model to capture post-compromise security and enhance the re-encryption indistinguishability to the CCA style. Guided by the new models, we provide a novel construction ReCrypt (^+), which satisfies our strengthened security definitions. The technical building block of homomorphic hash from a group may be of independent interests. We also study the relations among security notions; and a bit surprisingly, the folklore result in authenticated encryption that IND-CPA plus ciphertext integrity imply IND-CCA security does not hold for ciphertext dependent updatable encryption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After ratcheting attracted attention mostly due to practical real-world protocols, recently a line of work studied ratcheting as a primitive from a theoretic point of view. Literature in this line, pursuing the strongest security of ratcheting one can hope for, utilized for constructions strong, yet inefficient key-updatable primitives ‚Äì based on hierarchical identity based encryption (HIBE). As none of these works formally justified utilizing these building blocks, we answer the yet open question under which conditions their use is actually necessary.</p>
<p>We revisit these strong notions of ratcheted key exchange (RKE), and propose a more realistic (slightly stronger) security definition. In this security definition, both exposure of participants‚Äô local secrets and attacks against executions‚Äô randomness are considered. While these two attacks were partially considered in previous work, we are the first to unify them cleanly in a natural game based notion.</p>
<p>Our definitions are based on the systematic RKE notion by Poettering and R√∂sler (CRYPTO 2018). Due to slight (but meaningful) changes to regard attacks against randomness, we are ultimately able to show that, in order to fulfill strong security for RKE, public key cryptography with (independently) updatable key pairs is a necessary building block. Surprisingly, this implication already holds for the simplest RKE variant.</p>
<p>Hence, (1) we model optimally secure RKE under randomness manipulation to cover realistic attacks, (2) we (provably) extract the core primitive that is necessary to realize strongly secure RKE, and (3) our results indicate which relaxations in security allow for constructions that only rely on standard public key cryptography.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Garg et al. (Crypto 2015) initiated the study of cryptographic protocols over noisy channels in the non-interactive setting, namely when only one party speaks. A major question left open by this work is the completeness of finite channels, whose input and output alphabets do not grow with the desired level of security. In this work, we address this question by obtaining the following results:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Completeness of Bit-ROT with Inverse Polynomial Error. We show that bit-ROT (i.e., Randomized Oblivious Transfer channel, where each of the two messages is a single bit) can be used to realize general randomized functionalities with inverse polynomial error. Towards this, we provide a construction of string-ROT from bit-ROT with inverse polynomial error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Finite Channel is Complete with Negligible Error. To complement the above, we show that no finite channel can be used to realize string-ROT with negligible error, implying that the inverse polynomial error in the completeness of bit-ROT is inherent. This holds even with semi-honest parties and for computational security, and is contrasted with the (negligible-error) completeness of string-ROT shown by Garg et al.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characterization of Finite Channels Enabling Zero-Knowledge Proofs. An important instance of secure computation is zero-knowledge proofs. Noisy channels can potentially be used to realize truly non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, without trusted common randomness, and with non-transferability and deniability features that cannot be realized in the plain model. Garg et al. obtain such zero-knowledge proofs from the binary erasure channel (BEC) and the binary symmetric channel (BSC). We complete the picture by showing that in fact any non-trivial channel suffices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A succinct functional commitment (SFC) scheme for a circuit class (\mathbf {CC}) enables, for any circuit (\mathcal {C}\in \mathbf {CC}), the committer to first succinctly commit to a vector (\varvec{\alpha }), and later succinctly open the commitment to (\mathcal {C}(\varvec{\alpha }, \varvec{\beta })), where the verifier chooses (\varvec{\beta }) at the time of opening. Unfortunately, SFC commitment schemes are known only for severely limited function classes like the class of inner products. By making non-black-box use of SNARK-construction techniques, we propose a SFC scheme for the large class of semi-sparse polynomials. The new SFC scheme can be used to, say, efficiently (1) implement sparse polynomials, and (2) aggregate various interesting SFC (e.g., vector commitment and polynomial commitment) schemes. The new scheme is evaluation-binding under a new instantiation of the computational uber-assumption. We provide a thorough analysis of the new assumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Auditing a secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocol entails the validation of the protocol transcript by a third party that is otherwise untrusted. In this work, we introduce the concept of end-to-end verifiable MPC (VMPC), that requires the validation to provide a correctness guarantee even in the setting that all servers, trusted setup primitives and all the client systems utilized by the input-providing users of the MPC protocol are subverted by an adversary. To instantiate VMPC, we introduce a new concept in the setting of zero-knowlegde protocols that we term crowd verifiable zero-knowledge (CVZK). A CVZK protocol enables a prover to convince a set of verifiers about a certain statement, even though each one individually contributes a small amount of entropy for verification and some of them are adversarially controlled. Given CVZK, we present a VMPC protocol that is based on discrete-logarithm related assumptions. At the high level of adversity that VMPC is meant to withstand, it is infeasible to ensure perfect correctness, thus we investigate the classes of functions and verifiability relations that are feasible in our framework, and present a number of possible applications the underlying functions of which can be implemented via VMPC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proofs of partial knowledge demonstrate the possession of certain subsets of witnesses for a given collection of statements (x_1,\dots ,x_n). Cramer, Damg√•rd, and Schoenmakers (CDS), built proofs of partial knowledge, given ‚Äúatomic‚Äù protocols for individual statements (x_i), by having the prover randomly secret share the verifier‚Äôs challenge and using the shares as challenges for the atomic protocols. This simple and highly-influential transformation has been used in numerous applications, ranging from anonymous credentials to ring signatures.</p>
<p>We consider what happens if, instead of using the shares directly as challenges, the prover first hashes them. We show that this elementary enhancement can result in significant benefits:</p>
<p>the proof contains a single atomic transcript per statement (x_i),</p>
<p>it suffices that the atomic protocols are ({\kappa })-special sound for ({\kappa }\ge 2),</p>
<p>when compiled to a signature scheme using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, its unforgeability can be proved in the non-programmable random oracle model.</p>
<p>None of the above features is satisfied by the CDS transformation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Diophantine equation is a multi-variate polynomial equation with integer coefficients, and it is satisfiable if it has a solution with all unknowns taking integer values. Davis, Putnam, Robinson and Matiyasevich showed that the general Diophantine satisfiability problem is undecidable (giving a negative answer to Hilbert‚Äôs tenth problem) but it is nevertheless possible to argue in zero-knowledge the knowledge of a solution, if a solution is known to a prover.</p>
<p>We provide the first succinct honest-verifier zero-knowledge argument for the satisfiability of Diophantine equations with a communication complexity and a round complexity that grows logarithmically in the size of the polynomial equation. The security of our argument relies on standard assumptions on hidden-order groups. As the argument requires to commit to integers, we introduce a new integer-commitment scheme that has much smaller parameters than Damg√•rd and Fujisaki‚Äôs scheme. We finally show how to succinctly argue knowledge of solutions to several NP-complete problems and cryptographic problems by encoding them as Diophantine equations.</p>

</ol>
<p>Two-round selective opening secure commitment scheme.</p>
<p>Three-round concurrent zero knowledge and concurrent witness hiding argument for NP in the bare public-key model.</p>

<li>We present a simpler two-round weak zero knowledge and witness hiding argument for NP in the plain model under the sub-exponential hardness of factoring. Our technique also yields a significantly simpler proof that existing distinguisher-dependent simulatable zero knowledge protocols are also polynomial time simulatable against all distinguishers of a-priori bounded polynomial size.</li>

<p>The core conceptual idea underlying our individual simulation technique is an observation of the existence of nearly optimal extractors for all hard distributions: For any NP-instance(s) sampling algorithm, there exists a polynomial-size witness extractor (depending on the sampler‚Äôs functionality) that almost outperforms any circuit of a-priori bounded polynomial size in terms of the success probability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As blockchains grow in size, validating new transactions becomes more and more resource intensive. To deal with this, there is a need to discover compact encodings of the (effective) state of a blockchain‚Äîan encoding that allows for efficient proofs of membership and updates. In the case of account-based cryptocurrencies, the state can be represented by a key-value map, where keys are the account addresses and values consist of account balance, nonce, etc.</p>
<p>We propose a new commitment scheme for key-value maps whose size does not grow with the number of keys, yet proofs of membership are of constant-size. In fact, both the encoding and the proofs consist of just two and three group elements respectively (in groups of unknown order like class groups). Verifying and updating proofs involves just a few group exponentiations. Additive updates to key values enjoy the same level of efficiency too.</p>
<p>Key-value commitments can be used to build dynamic accumulators and vector commitments, which find applications in group signatures, anonymous credentials, verifiable databases, interactive oracle proofs, etc. Using our new key-value commitment, we provide the most efficient constructions of (sub)vector commitments to date.</p>

<p>Private Set Intersection Cardinality (PSI-CA) allows two parties, each holding a set of items, to learn the size of the intersection of those sets without revealing any additional information. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first protocol that allows one of the parties to delegate PSI-CA computation to untrusted servers. At the heart of our delegated PSI-CA protocol is a new oblivious distributed key PRF (Odk-PRF) abstraction, which may be of independent interest.</p>
<p>We explore in detail how to use our delegated PSI-CA protocol to perform privacy-preserving contact tracing. It has been estimated that a significant percentage of a given population would need to use a contact tracing app to stop a disease‚Äôs spread. Prior privacy-preserving contact tracing systems, however, impose heavy bandwidth or computational demands on client devices. These demands present an economic disincentive to participate for end users who may be billed per MB by their mobile data plan or for users who want to save battery life. We propose Catalic (ContAct TrAcing for LIghtweight Clients), a new contact tracing system that minimizes bandwidth cost and computation workload on client devices. By applying our new delegated PSI-CA protocol, Catalic shifts most of the client-side computation of contact tracing to untrusted servers, and potentially saves each user hundreds of megabytes of mobile data per day while preserving privacy.</p>
