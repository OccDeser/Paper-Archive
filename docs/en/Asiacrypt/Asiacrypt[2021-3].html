<blockquote>
<p>We study how to construct zkSNARKs whose SRS is universal and updatable, i.e., valid for all relations within a size-bound and to which a dynamic set of participants can indefinitely add secret randomness. Our focus is: efficient universal updatable zkSNARKs with linear-size SRS and their commit-and-prove variants. We both introduce new formal frameworks and techniques, as well as systematize existing ones.</p>
<p>We achieve a collection of zkSNARKs with different tradeoffs. One of our schemes achieves the smallest proof size and proving time compared to the state of art for proofs for arithmetic circuits. The language supported by this scheme is a variant of R1CS that we introduce, called R1CS-lite. Another of our constructions directly supports standard R1CS and achieves the fastest proving time for this type of constraints.</p>
<p>These results stem from different contributions: (1) a new algebraically-flavored variant of IOPs that we call Polynomial Holographic IOPs (PHPs); (2) a new compiler that combines our PHPs with commit-and-prove zkSNARKs (CP-SNARKs) for committed polynomials; (3) pairing-based realizations of these CP-SNARKs for polynomials; (4) constructions of PHPs for R1CS and R1CS-lite. Finally, we extend the compiler in item (2) to yield commit-and-prove universal zkSNARKs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the impossibility result of Gentry and Wichs, non-falsifiable assumptions are needed to construct (even non-zero-knowledge) adaptively sound succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs) for hard languages. It is important to understand whether this impossibility result is tight. While it is known how to construct adaptively sound non-succinct non-interactive arguments for (\mathsf {NP}) from falsifiable assumptions, adaptively sound SNARGs for (\mathsf {NP}) from non-falsifiable assumptions, and adaptively sound SNARGs for (\mathsf {P}) from falsifiable assumptions, there are no known non-adaptively sound SNARGs for (\mathsf {NP}) from falsifiable assumptions. We show that Gentry-Wichs is tight by constructing the latter. In addition, we prove it is non-adaptively knowledge-sound in the algebraic group model and Sub-ZK (i.e., zero-knowledge even if the CRS is subverted) under a non-falsifiable assumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We present a generalized inner product argument and demonstrate its applications to pairing-based languages. We apply our generalized argument to prove that an inner pairing product is correctly evaluated with respect to committed vectors of n source group elements. With a structured reference string (SRS), we achieve a logarithmic-time verifier whose work is dominated by (6 \log n) target group exponentiations. Proofs are of size (6 \log n) target group elements, computed using 6n pairings and 4n exponentiations in each source group.</p>
<p>We apply our inner product arguments to build the first polynomial commitment scheme with succinct (logarithmic) verification, (O(\sqrt{d})) prover complexity for degree d polynomials (not including the cost to evaluate the polynomial), and a SRS of size (O(\sqrt{d})). Concretely, this means that for (d=2^{28}), producing an evaluation proof in our protocol is (76\times ) faster than doing so in the KZG commitment scheme, and the CRS in our protocol is (1000\times ) smaller: 13 MB vs 13 GB for KZG.</p>
<p>As a second application, we introduce an argument for aggregating n Groth16 zkSNARKs into an (O(\log n)) sized proof. Our protocol is significantly faster (({&gt;}1000\times )) than aggregating SNARKs via recursive composition: we aggregate ({\sim }130,000) proofs in 25 min, versus 90 proofs via recursive composition. Finally, we further apply our aggregation protocol to construct a low-memory SNARK for machine computations that does not rely on recursive composition. For a computation that requires time T and space S, our SNARK produces proofs in space (\tilde{\mathcal {O}}(S+T)), which is significantly more space efficient than a monolithic SNARK, which requires space (\tilde{\mathcal {O}}(S \cdot T)).</p>

<p>We revisit the ceremony protocol of Groth‚Äôs SNARK [Bowe et al., 2017]. We show that the original construction can be simplified and optimized, and then prove its security in our new framework. Importantly, our construction avoids the random beacon model used in the original work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Significantly extending the framework of (Couteau and Hartmann, Crypto 2020), we propose a general methodology to construct NIZKs for showing that an encrypted vector (\boldsymbol{\chi }) belongs to an algebraic set, i.e., is in the zero locus of an ideal (\mathcal {I}) of a polynomial ring. In the case where (\mathcal {I}) is principal, i.e., generated by a single polynomial F, we first construct a matrix that is a ‚Äúquasideterminantal representation‚Äù of F and then a NIZK argument to show that (F (\boldsymbol{\chi }) = 0). This leads to compact NIZKs for general computational structures, such as polynomial-size algebraic branching programs. We extend the framework to the case where (\mathcal {I}) is non-principal, obtaining efficient NIZKs for R1CS, arithmetic constraint satisfaction systems, and thus for (\mathsf {NP}). As an independent result, we explicitly describe the corresponding language of ciphertexts as an algebraic language, with smaller parameters than in previous constructions that were based on the disjunction of algebraic languages. This results in an efficient GL-SPHF for algebraic branching programs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We introduce a novel framework for quantifying the bit security of security games. Our notion is defined with an operational meaning that a (\lambda )-bit secure game requires a total computational cost of (2^\lambda ) for winning the game with high probability, e.g., 0.99. We define the bit security both for search-type and decision-type games. Since we identify that these two types of games should be structurally different, we treat them differently but define the bit security using the unified framework to guarantee the same operational interpretation. The key novelty of our notion of bit security is to employ two types of adversaries: inner adversary and outer adversary. While the inner adversary plays a ‚Äúusual‚Äù security game, the outer adversary invokes the inner adversary many times to amplify the winning probability for the security game. We find from our framework that the bit security for decision games can be characterized by the information measure called the R√©nyi divergence of order 1/2 of the inner adversary. The conventional ‚Äúadvantage,‚Äù defined as the probability of winning the game, characterizes our bit security for search-type games. We present several security reductions in our framework for justifying our notion of bit security. Many of our results quantitatively match the results for the bit security notion proposed by Micciancio and Walter in 2018. In this sense, our bit security strengthens the previous notion of bit security by adding an operational meaning. A difference from their work is that, in our framework, the Goldreich-Levin theorem gives an optimal reduction only for ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù adversaries who output binary values in a balanced manner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When defining a security notion, one typically specifies what dishonest parties cannot achieve. For example, communication is confidential if a third party cannot learn anything about the messages being transmitted, and it is authentic if a third party cannot impersonate the real (honest) sender. For certain applications, however, security crucially relies on giving dishonest parties certain capabilities. As an example, in Designated Verifier Signature (DVS) schemes, one captures that only the designated verifier can be convinced of the authenticity of a message by guaranteeing that any dishonest party can forge signatures which look indistinguishable (to a third party) from original ones created by the sender.</p>
<p>However, composable frameworks cannot typically model such guarantees as they are only designed to bound what a dishonest party can do. In this paper we show how to model such guarantees‚Äîthat dishonest parties must have some capability‚Äîin the Constructive Cryptography framework (Maurer and Renner, ICS 2011). More concretely, we give the first composable security definitions for Multi-Designated Verifier Signature (MDVS) schemes‚Äîa generalization of DVS schemes.</p>
<p>The ideal world is defined as the intersection of two worlds. The first captures authenticity in the usual way. The second provides the guarantee that a dishonest party can forge signatures. By taking the intersection we have an ideal world with the desired properties.</p>
<p>We also compare our composable definitions to existing security notions for MDVS schemes from the literature. We find that only recently, 23 years after the introduction of MDVS schemes, sufficiently strong security notions were introduced capturing the security of MDVS schemes (Damg√•rd et al., TCC 2020). As we prove, however, these notions are still strictly stronger than necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this work we ask the following question: Can we transform any encryption scheme into a trapdoor function (TDF)? Alternatively stated, can we make any encryption scheme randomness recoverable? We propose a generic compiler that takes as input any encryption scheme with pseudorandom ciphertexts and adds a trapdoor to invert the encryption, recovering also the random coins. This universal TDFier only assumes in addition the existence of a hinting pseudorandom generator (PRG). Despite the simplicity, our transformation is quite general and we establish a series of new feasibility results:</p>
<p>The first identity-based TDF [Bellare et al. EUROCRYPT 2012] from the CDH assumption in pairing-free groups (or from factoring), thus matching the state of the art for identity-based encryption schemes. Prior works required pairings or LWE.</p>
<p>The first collusion-resistant attribute-based TDF (AB-TDF) for all ((NC^1), resp.) circuits from LWE (bilinear maps, resp.). Moreover, the first single-key AB-TDF from CDH. To the best of our knowledge, no AB-TDF was known in the literature (not even for a single key) from any assumption. We obtain the same results for predicate encryption.</p>
<p>As an additional contribution, we define and construct a trapdoor garbling scheme: A simulation secure garbling scheme with a hidden ‚Äútrigger‚Äù that allows the evaluator to fully recover the randomness used by the garbling algorithm. We show how to construct trapdoor garbling from the DDH or LWE assumption with an interplay of key-dependent message (KDM) and randomness-dependent message (RDM) techniques.</p>
<p>Trapdoor garbling allows us to obtain alternative constructions of (single-key) AB-TDFs with additional desirable properties, such as adaptive security (in the choice of the attribute) and projective keys. We expect trapdoor garbling to be useful in other contexts, e.g. in case where, upon successful execution, the evaluator needs to immediately verify that the garbled circuit was well-formed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Software watermarking schemes allow a user to embed an identifier into a piece of code such that the resulting program is nearly functionally-equivalent to the original program, and yet, it is difficult to remove the identifier without destroying the functionality of the program. Such schemes are often considered for proving software ownership or for digital rights management. Existing constructions of watermarking have focused primarily on watermarking pseudorandom functions (PRFs).</p>
<p>In this work, we revisit the definitional foundations of watermarking, and begin by highlighting a major flaw in existing security notions. Existing security notions for watermarking only require that the identifier be successfully extracted from programs that preserve the exact input/output behavior of the original program. In the context of PRFs, this means that an adversary that constructs a program which computes a quarter of the output bits of the PRF or that is able to distinguish the outputs of the PRF from random are considered to be outside the threat model. However, in any application (e.g., watermarking a decryption device or an authentication token) that relies on PRF security, an adversary that manages to predict a quarter of the bits or distinguishes the PRF outputs from random would be considered to have defeated the scheme. Thus, existing watermarking schemes provide very little security guarantee against realistic adversaries. None of the existing constructions of watermarkable PRFs would be able to extract the identifier from a program that only outputs a quarter of the bits of the PRF or one that perfectly distinguishes.</p>
<p>To address the shortcomings in existing watermarkable PRF definitions, we introduce a new primitive called a traceable PRF. Our definitions are inspired by similar definitions from public-key traitor tracing, and aim to capture a very robust set of adversaries: namely, any adversary that produces a useful distinguisher (i.e., a program that can break PRF security), can be traced to a specific identifier. We provide a general framework for constructing traceable PRFs via an intermediate primitive called private linear constrained PRFs. Finally, we show how to construct traceable PRFs from a similar set of assumptions previously used to realize software watermarking. Namely, we obtain a single-key traceable PRF from standard lattice assumptions and a fully collusion-resistant traceable PRF from indistinguishability obfuscation (together with injective one-way functions).</p>

<p>Protocols that make use of oblivious transfer (OT) rarely require just one instance. Usually, a batch of OTs is required‚Äînotably, when generating base OTs for OT extension. There is a natural way to optimize 2-round OT protocols when generating a batch, by reusing certain protocol messages across all instances. In this work we show that this batch optimization is error prone. We catalog many implementations and papers that have an incorrect treatment of this batch optimization, some of them leading to catastrophic leakage in OT extension protocols. We provide a full treatment of how to properly optimize recent 2-round OT protocols for the batch setting. Along the way we show several performance improvements to the OT protocol of McQuoid, Rosulek, and Roy (ACM CCS 2020). In particular, we show an extremely simple OT construction that may be of pedagogical interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The algebraic-group model (AGM), which lies between the generic group model and the standard model of computation, provides a means by which to analyze the security of cryptosystems against so-called algebraic adversaries. We formalize the AGM within the framework of universal composability, providing formal definitions for this setting and proving an appropriate composition theorem. This extends the applicability of the AGM to more-complex protocols, and lays the foundations for analyzing algebraic adversaries in a composable fashion. Our results also clarify the meaning of composing proofs in the AGM with other proofs and they highlight a natural form of independence between idealized groups that seems inherent to the AGM and has not been made formal before‚Äîthese insights also apply to the composition of game-based proofs in the AGM. We show the utility of our model by proving several important protocols universally composable for algebraic adversaries, specifically: (1) the Chou-Orlandi protocol for oblivious transfer, and (2) the SPAKE2 and CPace protocols for password-based authenticated key exchange.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is known, from the work of Dai et al. (in CRYPTO‚Äô17), that the PRF advantage of (\mathsf {XORP}) (bitwise-xor of two outputs of n-bit random permutations with domain separated inputs), against an adversary making q queries, is about (q/2^n) for (q \le 2^{n- 5}). The same bound can be easily shown to hold for (\mathsf {XORP}[k]) (bitwise-xor of k outputs n-bit pseudorandom random permutations with domain separated inputs), for (k \ge 3). In this work, we first consider multi-user security of (\mathsf {XORP}[3]). We show that the multi-user PRF advantage of (\mathsf {XORP}[3]) is about (\sqrt{uq_{\max }}/2^n) for all (q_{\max } \le 2^{n}/12), where u is the number of users and (q_{\max }) is the maximum number of queries the adversary can make to each user. In the multi-user setup, this implies that (\mathsf {XORP}[3]) gives security for (O(2^n)) users even allowing almost (O(2^n)) queries to each user. This also indicates significant improvement in the single-user setup (i.e., when (u =1)), where the distinguishing advantage of the adversary even after making (O(2^n)) queries is (O({1 \over \sqrt{2^n}})), i.e., negligible. Subsequently, we consider a simple efficient variant of (\mathsf {XORP}[3]) in which we use five calls to produce 2n bit output (instead of six calls in the case of (\mathsf {XORP}[3])). This variant also achieves similar level of security. As an immediate application, we can construct a variant of block cipher based counter mode which provides much higher security (both in the single-user and the multi-user setup) compared to the security of the encryption part of GCM at the cost of efficiency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sharing a common primitive for multiple functionalities is essential for lightweight cryptography, and NIST‚Äôs lightweight cryptography competition (LWC) considers the integration of hashing to AEAD. While permutations are natural primitive choices in such a goal, for design diversity, it is interesting to investigate how small block-cipher (BC) based and tweakable block-cipher (TBC) based schemes can be. Double-block-length (DBL) hash function modes are suitable to ensure the same security level for AEAD and hashing, but hard to achieve a small memory size. (\mathsf {Romulus}), a TBC-based finalist in NIST LWC, introduced the DBL hashing scheme (\mathsf {Romulus}\hbox {-}\mathsf {H}), but it requires (3n+k) bits of memory using an underlying primitive with an n-bit block and a k-bit (twea)key. Even the smallest DBL modes in the literature require (2n+k) bits of memory. Addressing this issue, we present new DBL modes (\mathsf {EXEX}\hbox {-}\mathsf {NI}) and (\mathsf {EXEX}\hbox {-}\mathsf {I}) achieving ((n+k))-bit state size, i.e., no extra memory in addition to (n+k) bits needed within the primitive. (\mathsf {EXEX}\hbox {-}\mathsf {NI}) is indifferentiable from a random oracle up to (n- \log n) bits. By instantiating it with (\mathsf {SKINNY}), we can provide hashing to (\mathsf {Romulus}) with zero memory overhead. (\mathsf {EXEX}\hbox {-}\mathsf {I}) is an optimized mode with collision resistance. We finally compare the hardware performances of (\mathsf {EXEX}\hbox {-}\mathsf {NI}), (\mathsf {EXEX}\hbox {-}\mathsf {I}), and (\mathsf {Romulus}\hbox {-}\mathsf {H}) with (\mathsf {SKINNY}\hbox {-}\mathsf {128}\hbox {-}\mathsf {384}). (\mathsf {EXEX}\hbox {-}\mathsf {NI}) and (\mathsf {EXEX}\hbox {-}\mathsf {I}) achieve the circuit-area reduction by 2,000+ GE, yielding the total areas being smaller than 70% of that of (\mathsf {Romulus}\hbox {-}\mathsf {H}).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this paper, we propose a new block cipher-based authenticated encryption scheme, dubbed the Synthetic Counter with Masking ((\mathsf {SCM})) mode. (\mathsf {SCM}) follows the (\mathsf {NSIV}) paradigm proposed by Peyrin and Seurin (CRYPTO 2016), where a keyed hash function accepts a nonce N with associated data and a message, yielding an authentication tag T, and then the message is encrypted by a counter-like mode using both T and N. Here we move one step further by encrypting nonces; in the encryption part, the inputs to the block cipher are determined by T, counters, and an encrypted nonce, and all its outputs are also masked by an (additional) encrypted nonce, yielding keystream blocks.</p>
<p>As a result, we obtain, for the first time, a block cipher-based authenticated encryption scheme of rate 1/2 that provides n-bit security with respect to the query complexity (ignoring the influence of message length) in the nonce-respecting setting, and at the same time guarantees graceful security degradation in the faulty nonce model, when the underlying n-bit block cipher is modeled as a secure pseudorandom permutation. Seen as a slight variant of (\mathsf {GCM})-(\mathsf {SIV}), (\mathsf {SCM}) is also parallelizable and inverse-free, and its performance is still comparable to (\mathsf {GCM})-(\mathsf {SIV}).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A substantial effort has been devoted to proving optimal bounds for the security of key-alternating ciphers with independent sub-keys in the random permutation model (e.g., Chen and Steinberger, EUROCRYPT ‚Äô14; Hoang and Tessaro, CRYPTO ‚Äô16). While common in the study of multi-round constructions, the assumption that sub-keys are truly independent is not realistic, as these are generally highly correlated and generated from shorter keys.</p>
<p>In this paper, we show the existence of non-trivial distributions of limited independence for which a t-round key-alternating cipher achieves optimal security. Our work is a natural continuation of the work of Chen et al. (CRYPTO ‚Äô14) which considered the case of (t = 2) when all-subkeys are identical. Here, we show that key-alternating ciphers remain secure for a large class of ((t-1))-wise and ((t-2))-wise independent distribution of sub-keys.</p>
<p>Our proofs proceed by generalizations of the so-called Sum-Capture Theorem, which we prove using Fourier-analytic techniques.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We propose a new construction for format-preserving encryption. Our design provides the flexibility for use in format-preserving encryption (FPE) and for static table-driven tokenization. Our algorithm is a substitution-permutation network based on random Sboxes. Using pseudorandom generators and pseudorandom functions, we prove a strong adaptive security based on the super-pseudorandom permutation assumption of our core design. We obtain empirical parameters to reach this assumption. We suggest parameters for quantum security.</p>
<p>Our design accommodates very small domains, with a radix a from 4 to the Unicode alphabet size and a block length (\ell ) starting 2. The number of Sbox evaluations per encryption is asymptotically (\ell ^{\frac{3}{2}}), which is also the number of bytes we need to generate using (\mathsf {AES}) in (\mathsf {CTR}) mode for each tweak setup. For instance, we tokenize 10 decimal digits using 29 (parallel) (\mathsf {AES}) computations to be done only once, when the tweak changes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LightMAC, by Luykx et al., is a block cipher based message authentication code (MAC). The simplicity of design and low overhead allows it to have very compact implementations. As a result, it has been recently chosen as an ISO/IEC standard MAC for lightweight applications. LightMAC has been shown to achieve query-length independent security bound of ( O(q^2/2^n) ) when instantiated with two independently keyed n-bit block ciphers, where q denotes the number of MAC queries and the query-length is upper bounded by ( (n-s)2^{s} ) bits for a fixed counter size s. In this paper, we aim to minimize the number of block cipher keys in LightMAC. First, we show that the original LightMAC instantiated with a single block cipher key, referred as 1k-LightMAC, achieves security bound of ( O(q^2/2^n) ) while the query-length is at least ( (n-s) ) bits and at most ( (n-s)\min {2^{n/4},2^s} ) bits. Second, we show that a minor variant of 1k-LightMAC, dubbed as LightMAC-ds, achieves security bound of ( O(q^2/2^n) ) while query-length is upper bounded by ( (n-s)2^{s-1} ) bits. Of independent interest, our security proof of 1k-LightMAC employs a novel sampling approach, called the reset-sampling, as a subroutine within the H-coefficient proof setup.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A growing number of lightweight block ciphers are proposed for environments such as the Internet of Things. An important contribution to the reduced implementation cost is a block length n of 64 or 96 bits rather than 128 bits. As a consequence, encryption modes and message authentication code (MAC) algorithms require security beyond the (2^{n/2}) birthday bound. This paper provides an extensive treatment of MAC algorithms that offer beyond birthday bound PRF security for both nonce-respecting and nonce-misusing adversaries. We study constructions that use two block cipher calls, one universal hash function call and an arbitrary number of XOR operations. We start with the separate problem of generically identifying all possible secure (n)-to-(n)-bit pseudorandom functions (PRFs) based on two block cipher calls. The analysis shows that the existing constructions EDM, SoP, and EDMD are the only constructions of this kind that achieve beyond birthday bound security. Subsequently we deliver an exhaustive treatment of MAC algorithms, where the outcome of a universal hash function evaluation on the message may be entered at any point in the computation of the PRF. We conclude that there are a total amount of nine schemes that achieve beyond birthday bound security, and a tenth construction that cannot be proven using currently known proof techniques. For these former nine MAC algorithms, three constructions achieve optimal n-bit security in the nonce-respecting setting, but are completely insecure if the nonce is reused. The remaining six constructions have 3n/4-bit security in the nonce-respecting setting, and only four out of these six constructions still achieve beyond the birthday bound security in the case of nonce misuse.</p>

<p>Integers can be decomposed in multiple ways. The choice of a recoding technique is generally dictated by performance considerations. The usual metric for optimizing the decomposition is the Hamming weight. In this work, we consider a different metric and propose new modified forms (i.e., integer representations using signed digits) that satisfy minimality requirements under the new metric. Specifically, we introduce what we call balanced non-adjacent forms and prove that they feature a minimal Euclidean weight. We also present efficient algorithms to produce these new minimal forms. We analyze their asymptotic and exact distributions. We extend the definition to modular integers and show similar optimality results. The balanced non-adjacent forms find natural applications in fully homomorphic encryption as they optimally reduce the noise variance in LWE-type ciphertexts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Encrypted multi-maps enable outsourcing the storage of a multi-map to an untrusted server while maintaining the ability to query privately. We focus on encrypted Boolean multi-maps that support arbitrary Boolean queries over the multi-map. Kamara and Moataz [Eurocrypt‚Äô17] presented the first encrypted multi-map, BIEX, that supports CNF queries with optimal communication, worst-case sublinear search time and non-trivial leakage.</p>
<p>We improve on previous work by presenting a new construction (\mathsf {CNFFilter}) for CNF queries with significantly less leakage than BIEX, while maintaining both optimal communication and worst-case sublinear search time. As a direct consequence our construction shows additional resistance to leakage-abuse attacks in comparison to prior works. For most CNF queries, (\mathsf {CNFFilter}) avoids leaking the result sets for any singleton queries for labels appearing in the CNF query. As an example, for the CNF query of the form ((\ell _1 \vee \ell _2) \wedge \ell _3), our scheme does not leak the result sizes of queries to (\ell _1, \ell _2) or (\ell _3) individually. On the other hand, BIEX does leak some of this information. This is just an example of the reduced leakage obtained by (\mathsf {CNFFilter}). The core of (\mathsf {CNFFilter}) is a new filtering algorithm that performs set intersections with significantly less leakage compared to prior works.</p>
<p>We implement (\mathsf {CNFFilter}) and show that (\mathsf {CNFFilter}) achieves faster search times and similar communication overhead compared to BIEX at the cost of a small increase in server storage.</p>

<p>The Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) and Brakerski/ Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) schemes are the two main homomorphic encryption (HE) schemes to perform exact computations over finite fields and integers. Although the schemes work with the same plaintext space, there are significant differences in their noise management, algorithms for the core homomorphic multiplication operation, message encoding, and practical usability. The main goal of our work is to revisit both schemes, focusing on closing the gap between the schemes by improving their noise growth, computational complexity of the core algorithms, and usability. The other goal of our work is to provide both theoretical and experimental performance comparison of BGV and BFV.</p>
<p>More precisely, we propose an improved variant of BFV where the encryption operation is modified to significantly reduce the noise growth, which makes the BFV noise growth somewhat better than for BGV (in contrast to prior results showing that BGV has smaller noise growth for larger plaintext moduli). We also modify the homomorphic multiplication procedure, which is the main bottleneck in BFV, to reduce its algorithmic complexity. Our work introduces several other novel optimizations, including lazy scaling in BFV homomorphic multiplication and an improved BFV decryption procedure in the Residue Number System (RNS) representation. We also develop a usable variant of BGV as a more efficient alternative to BFV for common practical scenarios.</p>
<p>We implement our improved variants of BFV and BGV in PALISADE and evaluate their experimental performance for several benchmark computations. The experimental results suggest that our BGV implementation is faster for intermediate and large plaintext moduli, which are often used in practical scenarios with ciphertext packing, while our BFV implementation is faster for small plaintext moduli.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a promising cryptographic primitive that enables computation over encrypted data, with a variety of applications including medical, genomic, and financial tasks. In Asiacrypt 2017, Cheon et al. proposed the (\mathsf {CKKS}) scheme to efficiently support approximate computation over encrypted data of real numbers. HE schemes including (\mathsf {CKKS}), nevertheless, still suffer from slow encryption speed and large ciphertext expansion compared to symmetric cryptography.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid framework, dubbed (\mathsf {RtF}) (Real-to-Finite-field) framework, that supports (\mathsf {CKKS}). The main idea behind this construction is to combine the (\mathsf {CKKS}) and the (\mathsf {FV}) homomorphic encryption schemes, and use a stream cipher using modular arithmetic in between. As a result, real numbers can be encrypted without significant ciphertext expansion or computational overload on the client side.</p>
<p>As an instantiation of the stream cipher in our framework, we propose a new HE-friendly cipher, dubbed (\mathsf {HERA}), and extensively analyze its security and efficiency. The main feature of (\mathsf {HERA}) is that it uses a simple randomized key schedule. Compared to recent HE-friendly ciphers such as (\mathsf {FLIP}) and (\mathsf {Rasta}) using randomized linear layers, (\mathsf {HERA}) requires a smaller number of random bits. For this reason, (\mathsf {HERA}) significantly outperforms existing HE-friendly ciphers on both the client and the server sides.</p>
<p>With the (\mathsf {RtF}) transciphering framework combined with (\mathsf {HERA}) at the 128-bit security level, we achieve small ciphertext expansion ratio with a range of 1.23 to 1.54, which is at least 23 times smaller than using (symmetric) (\mathsf {CKKS})-only, assuming the same precision bits and the same level of ciphertexts at the end of the framework. We also achieve 1.6 (\upmu )s and 21.7 MB/s for latency and throughput on the client side, which are 9085 times and 17.8 times faster than the (\mathsf {CKKS})-only environment, respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes enable to compute over encrypted data. Among them, TFHE [8] has the great advantage of offering an efficient method for bootstrapping noisy ciphertexts, i.e., reduce the noise. Indeed, homomorphic computation increases the noise in ciphertexts and might compromise the encrypted message. TFHE bootstrapping, in addition to reducing the noise, also evaluates (for free) univariate functions expressed as look-up tables. It however requires to have the most significant bit of the plaintext to be known a priori, resulting in the loss of one bit of space to store messages. Furthermore it represents a non negligible overhead in terms of computation in many use cases.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a solution to overcome this limitation, that we call Programmable Bootstrapping Without Padding ((\mathbf {WoP\text {-}PBS})). This approach relies on two building blocks. The first one is the multiplication √† la BFV [13] that we incorporate into TFHE. This is possible thanks to a thorough noise analysis showing that correct multiplications can be computed using practical TFHE parameters. The second building block is the generalization of TFHE bootstrapping introduced in this paper. It offers the flexibility to select any chunk of bits in an encrypted plaintext during a bootstrap. It also enables to evaluate many LUTs at the same time when working with small enough precision. All these improvements are particularly helpful in some applications such as the evaluation of Boolean circuits (where a bootstrap is no longer required in each evaluated gate) and, more generally, in the efficient evaluation of arithmetic circuits even with large integers. Those results improve TFHE circuit bootstrapping as well. Moreover, we show that bootstrapping large precision integers is now possible using much smaller parameters than those obtained by scaling TFHE ones.</p>
