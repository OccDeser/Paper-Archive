### 摘要
> A recent area of interest in cryptography is recursive composition of proof systems. One of the approaches to make recursive composition efficient involves cycles of pairing-friendly elliptic curves of prime order. However, known constructions have very low embedding degrees. This entails large parameter sizes, which makes the overall system inefficient. In this paper, we explore 2-cycles composed of curves from families parameterized by polynomials, and show that such cycles do not exist unless a strong condition holds. As a consequence, we prove that no 2-cycles can arise from the known families, except for those cycles already known. Additionally, we show some general properties about cycles, and provide a detailed computation on the density of pairing-friendly cycles among all cycles.

### 摘要
> Zero-knowledge and succinctness are two important properties that arise in the study of non-interactive arguments. Previously, Kitagawa et al. (TCC 2020) showed how to obtain a non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) argument for \(\textsf{NP}\) from a succinct non-interactive argument (SNARG) for \(\textsf{NP}\). In particular, their work demonstrates how to leverage the succinctness property from an argument system and transform it into a zero-knowledge property.

### 摘要
> Succinct arguments allow a prover to convince a verifier of the validity of any statement in a language, with minimal communication and verifier’s work. Among other approaches, lattice-based protocols offer solid theoretical foundations, post-quantum security, and a rich algebraic structure. In this work, we present some new approaches to constructing efficient lattice-based succinct arguments. Our main technical ingredient is a new commitment scheme based on vanishing polynomials, a notion borrowed from algebraic geometry. We analyse the security of such a commitment scheme, and show how to take advantage of the additional algebraic structure to build new lattice-based succinct arguments. A few highlights amongst our results are:

### 摘要
> We present Orbweaver, the first plausibly post-quantum functional commitment to achieve quasilinear prover time together with \(O(\log n)\) proof size and \(O(\log n \log \log n)\) verifier time. Orbweaver enables evaluation of linear maps on committed vectors over cyclotomic rings or the integers. It is extractable, preprocessing, non-interactive, structure-preserving, amenable to recursive composition, and supports logarithmic public proof aggregation. The security of our scheme is based on the k-R-ISIS assumption (and its knowledge counterpart), whereby we require a trusted setup to generate a universal structured reference string. We additionally use Orbweaver to construct a succinct polynomial commitment for integer polynomials.

### 摘要
> In 2002, Barak and Goldreich introduced the notion of a universal argument and constructed an interactive universal argument for non-deterministic computations based on polynomially hard collision-resistant hash functions. Since then, and especially in recent years, there have been tremendous developments in the construction of non-interactive succinct arguments for deterministic computations under standard hardness assumptions. However, the constructed succinct arguments can be proven universal only under sub-exponential assumptions.

### 摘要
> Motivated by the goal of proving statements that involve small subsets of a big database, we introduce and study the notion of projection codes. A standard error-correcting code allows one to encode a message \(\textbf{x}\) into a codeword \(\textbf{X}\), such that even if a constant fraction of \(\textbf{X}\) is corrupted, the message \(\textbf{x}\) can still be recovered. A projection code extends this guarantee to any subset of the bits of \(\textbf{x}\). Concretely, for every projection of \(\textbf{x}\) to a subset \(\textbf{s}\) of its coordinates, there is a subset \(\textbf{S}\) of comparable size such that the projected encoding \(\textbf{X}|_\textbf{S}\) forms a robust encoding of the projected message \(\textbf{x}|_\textbf{s}\).

### 摘要
> This paper introduces a SNARK called Brakedown. Brakedown targets R1CS, a popular NP-complete problem that generalizes circuit-satisfiability. It is the first built system that provides a linear-time prover, meaning the prover incurs O(N) finite field operations to prove the satisfiability of an N-sized R1CS instance. Brakedown ’s prover is faster, both concretely and asymptotically, than prior SNARK implementations. It does not require a trusted setup and may be post-quantum secure. Furthermore, it is compatible with arbitrary finite fields of sufficient size; this property is new among built proof systems with sublinear proof sizes. To design Brakedown, we observe that recent work of Bootle, Chiesa, and Groth (BCG, TCC 2020) provides a polynomial commitment scheme that, when combined with the linear-time interactive proof system of Spartan (CRYPTO 2020), yields linear-time IOPs and SNARKs for R1CS (a similar theoretical result was previously established by BCG, but our approach is conceptually simpler, and crucial for achieving high-speed SNARKs). A core ingredient in the polynomial commitment scheme that we distill from BCG is a linear-time encodable code. Existing constructions of such codes are believed to be impractical. Nonetheless, we design and engineer a new one that is practical in our context.

### 摘要
> Succinct arguments that rely on the Merkle-tree paradigm introduced by Kilian (STOC 92) suffer from larger proof sizes in practice due to the use of generic cryptographic primitives. In contrast, succinct arguments with the smallest proof sizes in practice exploit homomorphic commitments. However these latter are quantum insecure, unlike succinct arguments based on the Merkle-tree paradigm.

### 摘要
> We construct a succinct non-interactive argument (\(\textsf{SNARG} \)) for the class of monotone policy batch \(\textsf{NP} \) languages, under the Learning with Errors (\(\textsf{LWE} \)) assumption. This class is a subclass of \(\textsf{NP} \) that is associated with a monotone function \(f:\{0,1\}^k\rightarrow \{0,1\}\) and an \(\textsf{NP} \) language \(\mathcal {L} \), and contains instances \((x_1,\ldots ,x_k)\) such that \(f(b_1,\ldots ,b_k)=1\) where \(b_j=1\) if and only if \(x_j\in \mathcal {L} \). Our \(\textsf{SNARG} \)s are arguments of knowledge in the non-adaptive setting, and satisfy a new notion of somewhere extractability against adaptive adversaries.

### 摘要
> In Private Information Retrieval (PIR), a client wishes to retrieve the value of an index i from a public database of N values without leaking any information about i. In their recent seminal work, Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (EUROCRYPT 2020) introduced the first two-server PIR protocol with sublinear amortized server time and sublinear \(O(\sqrt{N} \log N)\) bandwidth. In a followup work, Shi et al. (CRYPTO 2021) reduced the bandwidth to polylogarithmic by proposing a construction based on privately puncturable pseudorandom functions, a primitive whose only construction known to date is based on heavy cryptographic primitives such as LWE. Partly because of this, their PIR protocol does not achieve concrete efficiency. In this paper we propose TreePIR, a two-server PIR protocol with sublinear amortized server time and polylogarithmic bandwidth whose security can be based on just the DDH assumption. TreePIR can be partitioned in two phases that are both sublinear: The first phase is remarkably simple and only requires pseudorandom generators. The second phase is a single-server PIR protocol on only \(\sqrt{N}\) indices, for which we can use the protocol by Döttling et al. (CRYPTO 2019) based on DDH, or, for practical purposes, the most concretely efficient single-server PIR protocol. Not only does TreePIR achieve better asymptotics than previous approaches while resting on weaker cryptographic assumptions, it also outperforms existing two-server PIR protocols in practice. The crux of our protocol is a new cryptographic primitive that we call weak privately puncturable pseudorandom functions, which we believe can have further applications.

> Over the past few years, homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) emerged as a compelling alternative to fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), due to its feasibility from an array of standard assumptions and its potential efficiency benefits. However, all known HSS schemes, with the exception of schemes built from FHE or indistinguishability obfuscation (iO), can only support two parties.

### 摘要
> Digital signature is an essential primitive in cryptography, which can be used as the digital analogue of handwritten signatures but also as a building block for more complex systems. In the latter case, signatures with specific features are needed, so as to smoothly interact with the other components of the systems, such as zero-knowledge proofs. This has given rise to so-called signatures with efficient protocols, a versatile tool that has been used in countless applications. Designing such signatures is however quite difficult, in particular if one wishes to withstand quantum computing. We are indeed aware of only one post-quantum construction, proposed by Libert et al. at Asiacrypt’16, yielding very large signatures and proofs.

### 摘要
> We present a framework for building practical anonymous credential schemes based on the hardness of lattice problems. The running time of the prover and verifier is independent of the number of users and linear in the number of attributes. The scheme is also compact in practice, with the proofs being as small as a few dozen kilobytes for arbitrarily large (say up to \(2^{128}\)) numbers of users with each user having several attributes. The security of our scheme is based on a new family of lattice assumptions which roughly states that given short pre-images of random elements in some set S, it is hard to create a pre-image for a fresh element in such a set. We show that if the set admits efficient zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of a commitment to a set element and its pre-image, then this yields practically-efficient privacy-preserving primitives such as blind signatures, anonymous credentials, and group signatures. We propose a candidate instantiation of a function from this family which allows for such proofs and thus yields practical lattice-based primitives.

### 摘要
> On the one hand, the web needs to be secured from malicious activities such as bots or DoS attacks; on the other hand, such needs ideally should not justify services tracking people’s activities on the web. Anonymous tokens provide a nice tradeoff between allowing an issuer to ensure that a user has been vetted and protecting the users’ privacy. However, in some cases, whether or not a token is issued reveals a lot of information to an adversary about the strategies used to distinguish honest users from bots or attackers.

### 摘要
> A large number of works prove lower bounds on space-time trade-offs in preprocessing attacks, i.e., trade-offs between the size of the advice and the time needed to break a scheme given such advice. We contend that the question of how much time is needed to produce this advice is equally important, and often highly non-trivial. However, this question has received significantly less attention. In this paper, we present lower bounds on the complexity of preprocessing attacks that depend on both offline and online time. As in the case of space-time trade-offs, we focus in particular on settings with ideal primitives, where both the offline and online time-complexities are approximated by the number of queries to the given primitive. We give generic results that highlight the benefits of salting to generically increase the offline costs of preprocessing attacks. The majority of our paper presents several results focusing on salted hash functions. In particular, we provide a fairly involved analysis of the pre-image- and collision-resistance security of the (two-block) Merkle-Damgård construction in our model.

### 摘要
> Suppose we have two hash functions \(h_1\) and \(h_2\), but we trust the security of only one of them. To mitigate this worry, we wish to build a hash combiner \(C^{h_1, h_2}\) which is secure so long as one of the underlying hash functions is. This question has been well-studied in the regime of collision resistance. In this case, concatenating the two hash function outputs clearly works. Unfortunately, a long series of works (Boneh and Boyen, CRYPTO’06; Pietrzak, Eurocrypt’07; Pietrzak, CRYPTO’08) showed no (noticeably) shorter combiner for collision resistance is possible.

### 摘要
> We initiate a formal study of individual cryptography. Informally speaking, an algorithm \(\textsf{Alg}\) is individual if, in every implementation of \(\textsf{Alg}\), there always exists an individual user with full knowledge of the cryptographic data S used by \(\textsf{Alg}\). In particular, it should be infeasible to design implementations of this algorithm that would hide S by distributing it between a group of parties using an MPC protocol or outsourcing it to a trusted execution environment.

### 摘要
> Two-source extractors are deterministic functions that, given two independent weak sources of randomness, output a (close to) uniformly random string of bits. Cheraghchi and Guruswami (TCC 2015) introduced two-source non-malleable extractors that combine the properties of randomness extraction with tamper resilience. Two-source non-malleable extractors have since then attracted a lot of attention, and have very quickly become fundamental objects in cryptosystems involving communication channels that cannot be fully trusted. Various applications of two-source non-malleable extractors include in particular non-malleable codes, non-malleable commitments, non-malleable secret sharing, network extraction, and privacy amplification with tamperable memory.

PAC Privacy characterizes the information-theoretic hardness to recover sensitive data given arbitrary information disclosure/leakage during/after any processing. Unlike the classic cryptographic definition and Differential Privacy (DP), which consider the adversarial (input-independent) worst case, PAC Privacy is a simulatable metric that quantifies the instance-based impossibility of inference. A fully automatic analysis and proof generation framework is proposed: security parameters can be produced with arbitrarily high confidence via Monte-Carlo simulation for any black-box data processing oracle. This appealing automation property enables analysis of complicated data processing, where the worst-case proof in the classic privacy regime could be loose or even intractable. Moreover, we show that the produced PAC Privacy guarantees enjoy simple composition bounds and the automatic analysis framework can be implemented in an online fashion to analyze the composite PAC Privacy loss even under correlated randomness. On the utility side, the magnitude of (necessary) perturbation required in PAC Privacy is not lower bounded by \({\varTheta }(\sqrt{d})\) for a d-dimensional release but could be O(1) for many practical data processing tasks, which is in contrast to the input-independent worst-case information-theoretic lower bound. Example applications of PAC Privacy are included with comparisons to existing works.

### 摘要
> An encryption scheme is Key Dependent Message (KDM) secure if it is safe to encrypt messages that can arbitrarily depend on the secret keys themselves. In this work, we show how to upgrade essentially the weakest form of KDM security into the strongest one. In particular, we assume the existence of a symmetric-key bit-encryption that is circular-secure in the 1-key setting, meaning that it maintains security even if one can encrypt individual bits of a single secret key under itself. We also rely on a standard CPA-secure public-key encryption. We construct a public-key encryption scheme that is KDM secure for general functions (of a-priori bounded circuit size) in the multi-key setting, meaning that it maintains security even if one can encrypt arbitrary functions of arbitrarily many secret keys under each of the public keys. As a special case, the latter guarantees security in the presence of arbitrary length key cycles. Prior work already showed how to amplify n-key circular to n-key KDM security for general functions. Therefore, the main novelty of our work is to upgrade from 1-key to n-key security for arbitrary n.

### 摘要
> Proving security bounds in contexts with a large number of users is one of the central problems in symmetric-key cryptography today. This paper introduces a new method for information-theoretic multi-user security proofs, called “the Squared-Ratio method”. At its core, the method requires the expectation of the square of the ratio of observing the so-called good transcripts (from Patarin’s H-coefficient technique) in the real and the ideal world. Central to the method is the observation that for information-theoretic adversaries, the KL-divergence for the multi-user security bound can be written as a summation of the KL-divergence of every single user.

### 摘要
> Existing proofs of adaptive security (e.g., in settings in which decryption keys are adaptively revealed) often rely on guessing arguments. Such guessing arguments can be simple (and, e.g., just involve guessing which keys are revealed), or more complex “partitioning” arguments. Since guessing directly and negatively impacts the loss of the corresponding security reduction, this leads to black-box lower bounds for a number of cryptographic scenarios that involve adaptive security.

### 摘要
> The goal of this research is to raise technical doubts regarding the usefulness of the repeated attempts by governments to curb Cryptography (aka the “Crypto Wars”), and argue that they, in fact, cause more damage than adding effective control. The notion of Anamorphic Encryption was presented in Eurocrypt’22 for a similar aim. There, despite the presence of a Dictator who possesses all keys and knows all messages, parties can arrange a hidden “anamorphic” message in an otherwise indistinguishable from regular ciphertexts (wrt the Dictator).
