### ÊëòË¶Å
> We introduce a new primitive, called trapdoor hash functions (TDH), which are hash functions \(\mathsf {H}: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^\lambda \) with additional trapdoor function-like properties. Specifically, given an index \(i\in [n]\), TDHs allow for sampling an encoding key \(\mathsf {ek}\) (that hides i) along with a corresponding trapdoor. Furthermore, given \(\mathsf {H}(x)\), a hint value \(\mathsf {E}(\mathsf {ek},x)\), and the trapdoor corresponding to \(\mathsf {ek}\), the \(i^{th}\) bit of x can be efficiently recovered. In this setting, one of our main questions is: How small can the hint value \(\mathsf {E}(\mathsf {ek},x)\) be? We obtain constructions where the hint is only one bit long based on DDH, QR, DCR, or LWE.

In particular, no polynomial-time attacker with s bits of non-uniform advice can find significantly more than s accepting proofs for false statements. Our first result is a construction of non-uniformly sound certificates for all¬†\(\mathbf{NP }\) in the random oracle model, where the attacker‚Äôs advice can depend arbitrarily on the random oracle.

### ÊëòË¶Å
> Ring signatures, introduced by [RST01], are a variant of digital signatures which certify that one among a particular set of parties has endorsed a message while hiding which party in the set was the signer. Ring signatures are designed to allow anyone to attach anyone else‚Äôs name to a signature, as long as the signer‚Äôs own name is also attached. But what guarantee do ring signatures provide if a purported signatory wishes to denounce a signed message‚Äîor alternatively, if a signatory wishes to later come forward and claim ownership of a signature? Prior security definitions for ring signatures do not give a conclusive answer to this question: under most existing definitions, the guarantees could go either way. That is, it is consistent with some standard definitions that a non-signer might be able to repudiate a signature that he did not produce, or that this might be impossible. Similarly, a signer might be able to later convincingly claim that a signature he produced is indeed his own, or not. Any of these guarantees might be desirable. For instance, a whistleblower might have reason to want to later claim an anonymously released signature, or a person falsely implicated in a crime associated with a ring signature might wish to denounce the signature that is framing them and damaging their reputation. In other circumstances, it might be desirable that even under duress, a member of a ring cannot produce proof that he did or did not sign a particular signature. In any case, a guarantee one way or the other seems highly desirable.

### ÊëòË¶Å
> ECDSA is a widely adopted digital signature standard. Unfortunately, efficient distributed variants of this primitive are notoriously hard to achieve and known solutions often require expensive zero knowledge proofs to deal with malicious adversaries. For the two party case, Lindell [Lin17] recently managed to get an efficient solution which, to achieve simulation-based security, relies on an interactive, non standard, assumption on Paillier‚Äôs cryptosystem. In this paper we generalize Lindell‚Äôs solution using hash proof systems. The main advantage of our generic method is that it results in a simulation-based security proof without resorting to non-standard interactive assumptions.

> Content moderation is crucial for stopping abusive and harassing messages in online platforms. Existing moderation mechanisms, such as message franking, require platform providers to be able to associate user identifiers to encrypted messages. These mechanisms fail in metadata-private messaging systems, such as Signal, where users can hide their identities from platform providers. The key technical challenge preventing moderation is achieving cryptographic accountability while preserving deniability.

> A software watermarking scheme enables one to embed a ‚Äúmark‚Äù (i.e., a message) within a program while preserving the program‚Äôs functionality. Moreover, there is an extraction algorithm that recovers an embedded message from a program. The main security goal is that it should be difficult to remove the watermark without destroying the functionality of the program. Existing constructions of watermarking focus on watermarking cryptographic functions like pseudorandom functions (PRFs); even in this setting, realizing watermarking from standard assumptions remains difficult. The first lattice-based construction of secret-key watermarking due to Kim and Wu (CRYPTO¬†2017) only ensures mark-unremovability against an adversary who does not have access to the mark-extraction oracle. The construction of Quach¬†et¬†al. (TCC¬†2018) achieves the stronger notion of mark-unremovability even if the adversary can make extraction queries, but has the drawback that the watermarking authority (who holds the watermarking secret key) can break pseudorandomness of all PRF keys in the family (including unmarked keys).

This is particularly useful for MPC with no honest majority, where input-independent correlated randomness enables a lightweight ‚Äúnon-cryptographic‚Äù online phase once the inputs are known. However, since the amount of randomness typically scales with the circuit size of the function being computed, securely generating correlated randomness forms an efficiency bottleneck, involving a large amount of communication and storage.

> Functional encryption (FE) is advanced encryption that enables us to issue functional decryption keys where functions are hardwired. When we decrypt a ciphertext of a message m by a functional decryption key where a function f is hardwired, we can obtain f(m) and nothing else. We say FE is selectively or adaptively secure when target messages are chosen at the beginning or after function queries are sent, respectively. In the weakly-selective setting, function queries are also chosen at the beginning. We say FE is single-key/collusion-resistant when it is secure against adversaries that are given only-one/polynomially-many functional decryption keys, respectively. We say FE is sublinearly-succinct/succinct when the running time of an encryption algorithm is sublinear/poly-logarithmic in the function description size, respectively.

### ÊëòË¶Å
> Cryptography is largely based on unproven assumptions, which, while believable, might fail. Notably if \(P = NP\), or if we live in Pessiland, then all current cryptographic assumptions will be broken. A compelling question is if any interesting cryptography might exist in Pessiland.

### ÊëòË¶Å
> A non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) protocol allows a prover to non-interactively convince a verifier of the truth of the statement without leaking any other information. In this study, we explore shorter NIZK proofs for all \(\mathbf{NP }\) languages. Our primary interest is NIZK proofs from falsifiable pairing/pairing-free group-based assumptions. Thus far, NIZKs in the common reference string model (CRS-NIZKs) for \(\mathbf{NP }\) based on falsifiable pairing-based assumptions all require a proof size at least as large as \(O(|C| \kappa )\), where C is a circuit computing the \(\mathbf{NP }\) relation and \(\kappa \) is the security parameter. This holds true even for the weaker designated-verifier NIZKs (DV-NIZKs). Notably, constructing a (CRS, DV)-NIZK with proof size achieving an additive-overhead \(O(|C|) + \mathsf {poly}(\kappa )\), rather than a multiplicative-overhead \(|C| \cdot \mathsf {poly}(\kappa )\), based on any falsifiable pairing-based assumptions is an open problem.

> Non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments (NIZKs) for \(\mathsf {NP}\) are an important cryptographic primitive, but we currently only have instantiations under a few specific assumptions. Notably, we are missing constructions from the learning with errors (LWE) assumption, the Diffie-Hellman (CDH/DDH) assumption, and the learning parity with noise (LPN) assumption.

### ÊëòË¶Å
> One of the approaches to constructing zero knowledge (ZK) arguments relies on ‚ÄúPCP techniques‚Äù that date back to influential works from the early 1990‚Äôs [Babai et al., Arora et al. 1991-2]. These techniques require only minimal cryptographic assumptions, namely, the existence of a family of collision-resistant hash functions [Kilian, STOC 1992], and achieve two remarkable properties: (i) all messages generated by the verifier are public random coins, and (ii) total verification time is merely poly-logarithmic in the time needed to na√Øvely execute the computation being verified [Babai et al., STOC 1991].

### ÊëòË¶Å
> We present Libra, the first zero-knowledge proof system that has both optimal prover time and succinct proof size/verification time. In particular, if C is the size of the circuit being proved (i) the prover time is O(C) irrespective of the circuit type; (ii) the proof size and verification time are both \(O(d\log C)\) for d-depth log-space uniform circuits (such as RAM programs). In addition Libra features an one-time trusted setup that depends only on the size of the input to the circuit and not on the circuit logic. Underlying Libra is a new linear-time algorithm for the prover of the interactive proof protocol by Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum (also known as GKR protocol), as well as an efficient approach to turn the GKR protocol to zero-knowledge using small masking polynomials. Not only does Libra have excellent asymptotics, but it is also efficient in practice. For example, our implementation shows that it takes 200¬†s to generate a proof for constructing a SHA2-based Merkle tree root on 256 leaves, outperforming all existing zero-knowledge proof systems. Proof size and verification time of Libra are also competitive.

### ÊëòË¶Å
> In this paper we give nearly-tight reductions for modern implicitly authenticated Diffie-Hellman protocols in the style of the Signal and Noise protocols, which are extremely simple and efficient. Unlike previous approaches, the combination of nearly-tight proofs and efficient protocols enables the first real-world instantiations for which the parameters can be chosen in a theoretically sound manner.

### ÊëòË¶Å
> Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocols allow two parties that share a password to establish a shared key in a way that is immune to offline attacks. Asymmetric PAKE (aPAKE) [20] adapts this notion to the common client-server setting, where the server stores a one-way hash of the password instead of the password itself, and server compromise allows the adversary to recover the password only via the (inevitable) offline dictionary attack. Most aPAKE protocols, however, allow an attacker to pre-compute a dictionary of hashed passwords, thus instantly learning the password on server compromise. Recently, Jarecki, Krawczyk, and Xu formalized a Universally Composable strong aPAKE (saPAKE) [23], which requires the password hash to be salted so that the dictionary attack can only start after the server compromise leaks the salt and the salted hash. The UC saPAKE protocol shown in [23], called OPAQUE, uses 3 protocol flows, 3‚Äì4 exponentiations per party, and relies on the One-More Diffie-Hellman assumption in ROM.

> We construct a broadcast and trace scheme (also known as trace and revoke or broadcast, trace and revoke) with N users, where the ciphertext size can be made as low as \(O(N^\varepsilon )\), for any arbitrarily small constant \(\varepsilon >0\). This improves on the prior best construction of broadcast and trace under standard assumptions by Boneh and Waters (CCS ‚Äò06), which had ciphertext size \(O(N^{1/2})\). While that construction relied on bilinear maps, ours uses a combination of the learning with errors (LWE) assumption and bilinear maps.
